<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>No login, no user accounts, and no selling of your personal data. Minimal logs are kept for debugging and abuse prevention (for example, URLs and IPs may briefly appear in server logs and are routinely purged).</p>
<p>We may use privacy-friendly analytics to understand which tools are used the most; when analytics are on, measurements are aggregated and you can disable them at any time. For a more detailed, user-facing view of cookies, ads, and local storage, see our <a href='/cookies.html'>Cookie &amp; privacy settings</a> page.</p>
<p>Google Ads (AdSense) may appear on some pages. Google may use cookies or similar technologies to deliver and measure ads; TinyUtils does not get access to your raw ad profile. For more about how Google uses information from sites like ours, see <a href='https://business.safety.google/privacy/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Google's Privacy &amp; Terms for partners</a>.</p>
