    <p>
      TinyUtils is a small, independent project maintained alongside other work. There’s no support team or ticketing
      system — just a person who cares about keeping these tools useful and reliable.
    </p>

    <h2>Best ways to reach out</h2>
    <p>
      The easiest way to report a bug or suggest an improvement is to open an issue on the project’s GitHub repository,
      or to send a short email with a clear subject line. When you write, include the tool you were using, what you
      expected to happen, and what actually happened.
    </p>

    <h2>What to expect</h2>
    <p>
      Because TinyUtils is maintained in spare time, replies may be delayed — especially around busy weeks. Most
      messages will get a quick acknowledgement first, then a follow-up once there’s time to investigate or ship a fix.
    </p>

    <h2>What this channel is for</h2>
    <p>
      Contact is welcome for bug reports, feature ideas, accessibility issues, and confusing UX. It’s not a good fit for
      detailed SEO audits, legal advice, or urgent production support. Tools are offered “as is”, and you’re responsible
      for how you use them.
