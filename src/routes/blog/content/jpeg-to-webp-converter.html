<p>
  If you’re still shipping a lot of JPEGs, WebP is usually an easy win.
  It often comes out smaller at the same “looks fine” quality level, and modern browsers support it.
</p>

<p>
  Converting JPEG → WebP is also a low-drama change: you don’t need to redesign anything.
  You just produce WebP versions and serve them where you can.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a> to convert JPEG to WebP.</li>
  <li>WebP is often smaller than JPEG at equivalent quality.</li>
  <li>All modern browsers support WebP (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).</li>
  <li>Keep original JPEGs for archival; serve WebP on the web.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why convert JPEG to WebP?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Smaller files</strong> — Same visual quality, less data</li>
  <li><strong>Faster pages</strong> — Quicker LCP, better Core Web Vitals</li>
  <li><strong>Lower bandwidth</strong> — Cheaper hosting, better mobile experience</li>
  <li><strong>Modern standard</strong> — WebP is the new default for web images</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How to convert JPEG to WebP (free, no upload)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your JPEG files.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>WebP</strong> as output format.</li>
  <li>Set quality (80-85% is a good default).</li>
  <li>Download — single file or ZIP for batches.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Browser‑based converters can do this locally (client‑side). If privacy matters, verify it:
  open DevTools → <strong>Network</strong>, convert one image, and make sure there’s no large upload request sending your file data to a server.
</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality settings guide</h2>
<p>
  WebP quality works similarly to JPEG quality:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>85-95%</strong> — Hard to tell from the original in normal viewing</li>
  <li><strong>75-85%</strong> — Excellent for web, barely noticeable difference</li>
  <li><strong>60-75%</strong> — Good for thumbnails and previews</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Start at 80%. If faces look off, bump to 85%. For product photos where detail matters, try 90%.
</p>

<h2 id="transparency">Wait, can WebP do transparency?</h2>
<p>
  Yes! Unlike JPEG, WebP supports alpha channels.
  This makes WebP a true "universal" format — it can replace both JPEG (photos) and PNG (graphics with transparency).
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Batch conversion</h2>
<p>
  Converting one image? Easy.
  Converting 500 product photos? Still easy. Drop them all in, TinyUtils processes them in parallel,
  and you get a ZIP file with all the WebP versions.
</p>

<h2 id="results">What to expect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Biggest wins:</strong> large photos and hero images usually shrink nicely.</li>
  <li><strong>Smaller wins:</strong> already heavily compressed JPEGs won’t move as much.</li>
  <li><strong>Best win of all:</strong> resize oversized images before you convert.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you’re optimizing a website, pair format conversion with responsive sizing.
  A perfectly optimized WebP can still be “too big” if you’re serving a 4000px image into an 800px slot.
</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Serving WebP on your site</h2>
<p>
  Once you have WebP versions, you can serve them with the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;picture&gt;
  &lt;source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp"&gt;
  &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  Browsers that support WebP get the smaller file; others fall back to JPEG.
</p>
<p>
  One reality check: “web support” doesn’t mean “everything supports it.”
  For email attachments, PowerPoint decks, and random legacy systems, JPEG is still the safest bet.
  That’s why keeping the JPEG fallback is useful even if you serve WebP on your site.
</p>

<h2 id="cms">What about WordPress/Shopify?</h2>
<p>
  Many modern CMS platforms can accept WebP uploads, and some will even serve WebP automatically.
  The details vary by platform, theme, and CDN, so don’t assume — test one image and confirm what’s actually being served.
  If you want maximum control, the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> approach above is the boring, reliable option.
</p>

<h2 id="when-not">When you don’t need to convert</h2>
<p>
  If you already use an image CDN that serves WebP/AVIF automatically (based on the visitor’s browser), you might not need to do manual conversions at all.
  In that case, your job is mostly: upload good source images, make sure dimensions are sane, and let the CDN handle formats.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is WebP always smaller than JPEG?</h3>
<p>
  Often, yes. In rare cases (already heavily compressed JPEGs), the savings can be small.
  The fastest way to know is to convert one representative image and compare.
</p>

<h3>Should I keep my original JPEGs?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. WebP is lossy, so you can't perfectly recreate the original.
  Keep JPEGs for editing/archival, serve WebP on the web.
</p>

<h3>What about AVIF?</h3>
<p>
  AVIF is even more efficient than WebP, but browser support is still catching up.
  For maximum compatibility, WebP is the safe choice. If you want to serve AVIF too, use a fallback (<code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>) so older browsers still get WebP/JPEG.
