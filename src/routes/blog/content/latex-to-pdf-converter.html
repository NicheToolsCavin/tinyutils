<p>
  LaTeX is popular in academia because it handles math, references, and long documents without drifting. But you usually share a PDF, not a .tex file. Converting LaTeX to PDF is the step that turns your source into something anyone can open, annotate, and submit.

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/text-converter/">TinyUtils Document Converter</a></li>
  <li>Upload your .tex file (and supporting files as ZIP if needed)</li>
  <li>Select <strong>PDF</strong> as output</li>
  <li>Download the compiled PDF</li>

<h2 id="understanding-formats">Understanding LaTeX and PDF</h2>

<h3>What is LaTeX?</h3>
<p>
  LaTeX (pronounced "lay-tech" or "lah-tech") is a typesetting system built on Donald Knuth's TeX. Since its creation by Leslie Lamport in the 1980s, it’s become a default workflow in a lot of academic and scientific writing. People use it because it handles math, references, and long documents in a predictable way.
</p>
<p>
  LaTeX works differently from word processors. Instead of formatting text directly, you write plain text with markup commands that describe document structure: \section{} for headings, \begin{equation} for math, \cite{} for references. LaTeX then compiles this source code into beautifully typeset output. The separation of content and presentation gives you precise control while maintaining consistency across any document length.
</p>

<h3>What is PDF?</h3>
<p>
  PDF (Portable Document Format) is the universal format for document distribution. Developed by Adobe in the early 1990s, PDF locks document appearance so viewers see exactly what creators intended—same fonts, same layout, same page breaks—regardless of operating system, device, or software. PDF has become the de facto standard for sharing finished documents in academia, business, and government.
</p>
<p>
  For academic work, PDF is essential. Journals require PDF submissions. ArXiv accepts PDF uploads. Conference proceedings distribute papers as PDF. Grant agencies expect PDF proposals. Converting LaTeX to PDF is the final step in the academic writing workflow—the point where your carefully crafted document becomes shareable with the world.
</p>

<h2 id="why">Why Convert LaTeX to PDF?</h2>

<h3>1. Journal and Conference Submission</h3>
<p>
  Academic venues require PDF submissions. Whether you're submitting to Nature, IEEE, ACM, PLOS, or a specialized journal, the submission system expects PDF. LaTeX source files are for your workflow; PDF is what reviewers and readers receive.
</p>

<h3>2. ArXiv Preprint Sharing</h3>
<p>
  arXiv, a widely used preprint server for physics, mathematics, and computer science, accepts both LaTeX source and PDF. Uploading source lets arXiv compile it, but many authors upload a PDF because it’s predictable: you can open the file and see what you’re submitting. Either way, it’s worth a quick sanity check before you upload.
</p>

<h3>3. Collaborator Review</h3>
<p>
  Not everyone has LaTeX installed. When sharing drafts with collaborators—especially those outside academia—PDF provides universal access. Reviewers can read, annotate, and comment on PDFs without needing to compile LaTeX source.
</p>

<h3>4. Print-Ready Output</h3>
<p>
  PDF is designed for printing. When your thesis needs to be printed and bound, when your conference paper needs physical distribution, when your grant proposal requires a printed copy, PDF ensures exact reproduction of your LaTeX output.
</p>

<h3>5. No LaTeX Installation Required</h3>
<p>
  Full LaTeX distributions are large—several gigabytes for a complete installation. If you're on a borrowed computer, a Chromebook, or simply don't want to maintain a LaTeX installation, an online converter gives you PDF output without local software requirements.
</p>

<h3>6. More Predictable Compilation</h3>
<p>
  LaTeX compilation can fail for lots of boring reasons: missing packages, font issues, syntax errors, or path problems. An online converter can help if your local setup is broken (or you’re on a machine without TeX installed). Still, treat it like any conversion: open the PDF and make sure nothing went weird.
</p>

<h2 id="preserved">What Compiles from LaTeX to PDF</h2>
<p>
  LaTeX to PDF conversion preserves everything that LaTeX produces:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Text and structure</strong> — All sections, subsections, paragraphs, and document organization</li>
  <li><strong>Mathematical notation</strong> — Equations render with LaTeX's famous precision and beauty</li>
  <li><strong>Tables and figures</strong> — Including captions, labels, and cross-references</li>
  <li><strong>Bibliography</strong> — BibTeX/BibLaTeX references compile and format correctly</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-references</strong> — \ref{}, \cite{}, and other references resolve properly</li>
  <li><strong>Typography</strong> — Fonts, kerning, ligatures, and micro-typography</li>
  <li><strong>Page layout</strong> — Margins, headers, footers, and page numbering</li>
  <li><strong>Hyperlinks</strong> — Using hyperref, your PDF can include clickable links and bookmarks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multi-Pass Processing</h3>
<p>
  LaTeX often requires multiple compilation passes to resolve cross-references, build tables of contents, and process bibliographies. The converter handles this automatically, running as many passes as needed to produce a fully resolved PDF.
</p>

<h2 id="steps">How to Convert LaTeX to PDF</h2>

<h3>Using TinyUtils Document Converter</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <a href="/tools/text-converter/">TinyUtils Document Converter</a></li>
  <li>Click the upload area or drag and drop your .tex file</li>
  <li>Select <strong>PDF</strong> from the output format dropdown</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Convert</strong> to compile the document</li>
  <li>Download your PDF</li>
</ol>
<p>
  For simple documents with no external dependencies, single-file upload works well. The converter compiles your LaTeX source and returns a PDF you can download and review.
</p>

<h3>Multi-File Projects</h3>
<p>
  Most LaTeX projects include multiple files: bibliography (.bib), images, custom style files, and possibly split .tex files using \input{} or \include{}. For these projects:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a ZIP file containing your main .tex file and all dependencies</li>
  <li>Upload the ZIP to the converter</li>
  <li>The converter extracts files and compiles from the main .tex file</li>
  <li>Download your compiled PDF</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Name your main file clearly (main.tex, paper.tex, thesis.tex) so the converter can identify it as the compilation entry point.
</p>

<h3>Batch Conversion</h3>
<p>
  Need to compile multiple papers or chapters? Upload multiple .tex files (or multiple ZIP archives) at once. The converter processes each independently and delivers all PDFs in a single ZIP download.
</p>

<h2 id="packages">Package Support</h2>
<p>
  LaTeX projects live and die by their packages. The converter can compile plenty of everyday documents, but it won’t have every niche package, custom font, or department template under the sun.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If your doc uses common packages (<code>amsmath</code>, <code>graphicx</code>, <code>hyperref</code>), you’ll usually be fine.</li>
  <li>If it uses custom <code>.cls</code>/<code>.sty</code> files, include them in the ZIP alongside your <code>.tex</code>.</li>
  <li>If it relies on shell-escape tooling (for example <code>minted</code>), expect trouble — that’s the kind of project that’s happier compiled locally.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The fastest way to know is to try. If compilation fails, it’s usually either “missing a file” (add it to the ZIP) or “this template needs a specific local setup.”
</p>

<h2 id="engines">Engines</h2>
<p>
  LaTeX can be compiled with different engines (pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, LuaLaTeX). If your template depends on system fonts, non‑Latin scripts, or a specific engine, compile locally with the setup your template expects.
</p>

<h2 id="bibliography">Bibliographies</h2>
<p>
  If you’re using citations, include your <code>.bib</code> file in the ZIP (and any style files your template needs). If the output comes back with missing references, it usually means the toolchain didn’t run the same way your local setup does — in that case, local compilation is the quickest fix.
</p>

<h2 id="use-cases">Common Use Cases</h2>

<h3>Journal Article Submission</h3>
<p>
  You've finished your paper in LaTeX using the journal's template. Now you need the PDF for submission. Upload your .tex file and any dependencies, download the compiled PDF, and submit to the journal portal.
</p>

<h3>Thesis Compilation</h3>
<p>
  Thesis documents are complex: multiple chapters, extensive bibliographies, numerous figures. Package everything in a ZIP file, compile through the converter, and get your thesis as a single PDF ready for committee review or institutional submission.
</p>

<h3>Conference Paper Preparation</h3>
<p>
  Conference deadlines are tight. When your local LaTeX installation has issues—missing packages, version conflicts, mysterious errors—an online converter with a clean environment often succeeds where local compilation fails.
</p>

<h3>Quick Compilation on Any Device</h3>
<p>
  You're traveling with only a tablet or borrowed laptop. Your co-author sends a .tex file that needs review. Upload to the converter, download the PDF, and review the document—no LaTeX installation required.
</p>

<h3>Consistent Output Across Collaborators</h3>
<p>
  Different team members have different LaTeX installations with different package versions. Compiling through a single online converter ensures everyone sees the same output, eliminating "works on my machine" problems.
</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>

<h3>Compilation Fails</h3>
<p>
  LaTeX compilation errors usually indicate syntax problems or missing dependencies. Check that all \input{} and \include{} files are present, all referenced images exist, and your .bib file is included if using citations.
</p>

<h3>Missing Images</h3>
<p>
  If images don't appear, ensure they're included in your ZIP upload with correct paths. LaTeX references images relative to the main .tex file location. Verify your \includegraphics{} paths match the actual file locations.
</p>

<h3>Bibliography Not Appearing</h3>
<p>
  Missing bibliographies usually mean the .bib file wasn't included or the \bibliography{} command has the wrong filename. Include your .bib file in the upload and verify the filename matches your \bibliography{} command (without the .bib extension).
</p>

<h3>Wrong Fonts</h3>
<p>
  If fonts look different than expected, the document may require XeLaTeX or specific font packages. pdfLaTeX uses different fonts than XeLaTeX. For standard academic documents, pdfLaTeX fonts are typically appropriate.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What LaTeX engine is used?</h3>
<p>
  pdfLaTeX is the default engine, suitable for most documents. Some converters offer XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX for documents requiring Unicode fonts or advanced features.
</p>

<h3>What about BibTeX references?</h3>
<p>
  Include your .bib file in the upload. The converter runs BibTeX automatically and processes your bibliography. Multiple compilation passes resolve all citations.
</p>

<h3>Can I compile multi-file projects?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. Upload a ZIP containing all your .tex files, images, .bib files, and any other dependencies. The converter finds the main file and compiles it with all includes resolved.
</p>

<h3>What if I need a specific document class?</h3>
<p>
  Common document classes (article, report, book) and many journal classes (IEEE, ACM, Springer) are included. Very specialized classes may need to be included in your ZIP upload.
</p>

<h3>Will hyperlinks work in the PDF?</h3>
<p>
  If your document uses the hyperref package, the PDF will include clickable links, bookmarks, and proper PDF metadata. This is standard for modern academic documents.
</p>

<h3>What's the maximum file size?</h3>
<p>
  The converter handles uploads up to 50MB, which accommodates most documents including those with many images. Very large projects may need image optimization before upload.
</p>

<h2 id="why-online">Why Use an Online Converter?</h2>
