<p>
  Choosing between an online converter and an offline converter feels like a philosophical debate until you have a deadline.
  Then it becomes: “what will work <em>right now</em>, and will it mess up my formatting?”
</p>

<p>
  This guide is a practical decision tree.
  You’ll get a clear answer for common scenarios (sensitive docs, big batches, tricky formatting), plus a short QA checklist.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Quick, one-off conversions:</strong> online is usually easiest.</li>
  <li><strong>Sensitive/confidential files:</strong> offline is usually safer.</li>
  <li><strong>Formatting matters (tables, math, complex layouts):</strong> plan to QA either way.</li>
  <li><strong>Batch jobs / automation:</strong> offline tools and scripts often win.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tradeoffs">The real tradeoffs</h2>

<h3>1) Privacy</h3>
<p>
  Offline conversion is the simplest privacy story: the file stays on your machine.
  With online conversion, you’re uploading the file somewhere — which might be totally fine for a resume,
  and totally not fine for client contracts.
</p>

<p>
  If you do use an online converter, look for clear privacy language: what’s stored, for how long, and why.
  TinyUtils has a <a href="/privacy.html">privacy policy</a> and <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a> that describe the current behavior.
  (Still: if the file is truly sensitive, offline is the conservative choice.)
</p>

<h3>2) Convenience</h3>
<p>
  Online tools are great for “I’m on a laptop with no setup time.”
  Open a tab, drop a file, download the result.
  No installs. No dependencies.
</p>

<h3>3) Formatting fidelity</h3>
<p>
  This is the sneaky one.
  Some conversions are easy (DOCX ↔ PDF for simple docs).
  Others are inherently messy (complex tables, footnotes, math, custom fonts).
</p>

<p>
  The important mindset: conversion is translation.
  Translation is never 100% perfect.
  Your job is to choose the best translator <em>and then proofread</em>.
</p>

<h3>4) Speed</h3>
<p>
  Offline can be faster for big batches (no upload time).
  Online can be faster for one-offs (no install time).
  Pick the bottleneck you’d rather have.
</p>

<h3>5) Automation</h3>
<p>
  If you need to convert hundreds of files repeatedly, offline tools and scripts tend to be the best fit.
  They’re more controllable and reproducible.
  Online tools are usually better for human-in-the-loop workflows.
</p>

<h2 id="when-online">When an online converter is the best choice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You’re doing a quick one-off conversion.</li>
  <li>You’re on a locked-down machine (no installs).</li>
  <li>You need something shareable for non-technical teammates.</li>
  <li>The file is not sensitive (or your org approves the workflow).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If that’s you, try the TinyUtils converter:
  <a href="/tools/text-converter/">Document Converter</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="when-offline">When an offline converter is the best choice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The document is confidential or regulated.</li>
  <li>You need repeatable batch conversions.</li>
  <li>You want full control over fonts, templates, and exact tool versions.</li>
  <li>You’re converting the same format combination often.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Offline examples (depending on formats):
  Pandoc, LibreOffice, and other local tooling.
  (Which one is “best” depends heavily on what you’re converting.)
</p>

<h2 id="qa">QA checklist (do this every time you care about quality)</h2>
<p>
  If you only do one thing: do a 60-second spot-check.
  It will save you from the “everything looked fine until the PDF went to the client” moment.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Headings:</strong> are H1/H2/H3 preserved?</li>
  <li><strong>Lists:</strong> do bullets and numbering still make sense?</li>
  <li><strong>Tables:</strong> are columns aligned and readable?</li>
  <li><strong>Links:</strong> are URLs still clickable and correct?</li>
  <li><strong>Images:</strong> missing images are common — check them.</li>
  <li><strong>“Blank output” check:</strong> scroll the output. Seriously. It happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  One extra sanity check if you have a deadline: make sure the output isn’t blank or missing entire sections.
  It happens more than anyone wants to admit.
</p>

<h2 id="hybrid">A hybrid workflow (often the sane middle)</h2>
<p>
  You don’t have to be ideologically online or offline.
  A lot of teams end up with a hybrid workflow that keeps both privacy and convenience in check:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Draft locally</strong> (Word/LibreOffice/Markdown) where you have full control.</li>
  <li><strong>Convert in the easiest place</strong> for that one step (online for convenience, offline for sensitive docs).</li>
  <li><strong>QA the output</strong>, then use the converted file as the shareable “final.”</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The key is being intentional about which documents are safe to upload and which aren’t. Write that rule down once, and you’ll stop re‑arguing it every time a deadline hits.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is “online converter” automatically unsafe?</h3>
<p>
  Not automatically.
  It depends on the tool’s privacy posture, your risk tolerance, and the content.
  But if the file is truly sensitive, offline is the simplest safe answer.
</p>

<h3>Which format conversions are the hardest?</h3>
<p>
  Complex layouts (tables, footnotes, math, fancy typography) are harder.
  Plain text and simple docs are easier.
