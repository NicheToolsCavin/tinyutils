  JPEG is the internet's workhorse for photos.
  It's everywhere: product images, hero banners, profile pictures.
  But unoptimized JPEGs can bloat your pages and kill your Core Web Vitals.
</p>

<p>
  The fix is simple: compress them. A well‑optimized JPEG usually looks the same to a normal human
  while taking up a lot less space. Here’s how to do it without turning faces into watercolor.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a> for free JPEG compression.</li>
  <li>80-85% quality is a good starting point for most photos.</li>
  <li>Resize images to their display size — don't serve 4000px images at 800px.</li>
  <li>For even smaller files, convert to WebP.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why compress JPEGs?</h2>
<p>
  Every KB counts on the web. Large images:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slow down page loads (especially on mobile)</li>
  <li>Hurt your Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score</li>
  <li>Increase hosting bandwidth costs</li>
  <li>Frustrate users on slow connections</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A 2 MB hero image that could be 200 KB is leaving performance on the table.
</p>

<h2 id="how">How to compress JPEG online (step-by-step)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your JPEG files (batch works too).</li>
  <li>Keep format as <strong>JPEG</strong> (or switch to WebP for even smaller files).</li>
  <li>Set quality to 80-85% for photos.</li>
  <li>Optional: set max width to resize large images.</li>
  <li>Download the compressed files.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="quality">Finding the right quality setting</h2>
<p>
  JPEG quality is a tradeoff: lower quality = smaller files = more artifacts.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>90-100%</strong> — Near-original quality, minimal savings</li>
  <li><strong>80-90%</strong> — Sweet spot for most photos (recommended)</li>
  <li><strong>70-80%</strong> — Noticeable softness, but acceptable for thumbnails</li>
  <li><strong>Below 60%</strong> — Visible blocky artifacts, avoid for important images</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The trick: start at 80%, look at the result, adjust up if faces look weird.
</p>

<h2 id="resize">Resize before compressing</h2>
<p>
  This is the secret weapon. A 5000×3000 photo will be huge no matter the quality setting.
  If it's displayed at 1200px wide, resize to 2400px (2x for retina displays).
</p>
<p>
  Resizing often saves more than quality reduction and has zero visual impact.
</p>

<h2 id="dont-jpeg">Don’t JPEG the wrong things</h2>
<p>
  JPEG is great for photos. It’s often a terrible choice for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Screenshots</strong> (text gets crunchy fast)</li>
  <li><strong>Logos and icons</strong> (sharp edges turn fuzzy)</li>
  <li><strong>Images with transparency</strong> (JPEG can’t do it)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For those, PNG or WebP is usually the better move. If you’re optimizing UI screenshots, start with
  <a href="/blog/compress-png-online/">PNG compression</a> or convert to WebP.
</p>

<h2 id="metadata">Strip metadata (EXIF)</h2>
<p>
  Camera JPEGs include metadata: GPS coordinates, camera model, timestamps.
  In many browser‑based conversions, that metadata doesn’t survive the export — which can be good for privacy.
  If you actually need the metadata (date/location), keep the original file as your “source of truth.”
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Batch compression</h2>
<p>
  Got 100 product photos? Don't compress them one by one.
  Drop the whole folder into TinyUtils, set quality once, and download a ZIP.
</p>

<h2 id="webp">Should you switch to WebP instead?</h2>
<p>
  WebP produces smaller files than JPEG at the same quality.
  If your users are on modern browsers (2020+), WebP is the better choice.
  You can convert JPEG → WebP in the same tool.
</p>

<h2 id="results">What to expect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Resizing</strong> usually beats “more compression” for big wins.</li>
  <li><strong>Quality 80–85%</strong> is a solid starting point for most photos.</li>
  <li><strong>Very detailed photos</strong> (foliage, noise, grain) show artifacts sooner than simple images.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools">Why not use Photoshop/GIMP?</h2>
<p>
  You can! But for quick batch compression:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No software to install</li>
  <li>Works on any device (including phones)</li>
  <li>Faster for simple "compress and go" workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For heavy editing, use your image editor. For compression, use a compressor.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Does compressing a JPEG multiple times reduce quality?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. Each re-compression introduces more artifacts.
  Always start from the original when possible.
</p>

<h3>What's the smallest I can make a JPEG?</h3>
<p>
  Depends on the image. A complex photo compresses less than a simple graphic.
  Resize + 80% quality is usually the practical minimum before visible degradation.
</p>

<h3>Can I compress JPEGs without losing quality?</h3>
<p>
  There are “lossless-ish” JPEG optimizations, but the savings are usually modest.
  For meaningful size reduction you typically need lossy compression — ideally paired with resizing — and then you pick a quality level that still looks good for your use case.
</p>

<h2 id="next">Next steps</h2>
<p>
  Time to shrink those JPEGs. Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>,
  drop your photos, and aim for "looks the same, half the size."
</p>
<p>
  If you’re doing this for a website, spot-check the result in the browser: make sure it still looks sharp at the size you actually display it.
  No one wins awards for “technically smaller, visibly worse.”
