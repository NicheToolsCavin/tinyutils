  JPEG is the internet's workhorse for photos.
  It's everywhere: product images, hero banners, profile pictures.
  But unoptimized JPEGs can bloat your pages and kill your Core Web Vitals.
</p>

<p>
  The fix is simple: compress them. A well-optimized JPEG looks identical to the eye
  but weighs 50-70% less. Here's how to do it right.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a> for free JPEG compression.</li>
  <li>80-85% quality is the sweet spot for most photos.</li>
  <li>Resize images to their display size — don't serve 4000px images at 800px.</li>
  <li>For even smaller files, convert to WebP.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why compress JPEGs?</h2>
<p>
  Every KB counts on the web. Large images:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slow down page loads (especially on mobile)</li>
  <li>Hurt your Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score</li>
  <li>Increase hosting bandwidth costs</li>
  <li>Frustrate users on slow connections</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A 2 MB hero image that could be 200 KB is leaving performance on the table.
</p>

<h2 id="how">How to compress JPEG online (step-by-step)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your JPEG files (batch works too).</li>
  <li>Keep format as <strong>JPEG</strong> (or switch to WebP for even smaller files).</li>
  <li>Set quality to 80-85% for photos.</li>
  <li>Optional: set max width to resize large images.</li>
  <li>Download the compressed files.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="quality">Finding the right quality setting</h2>
<p>
  JPEG quality is a tradeoff: lower quality = smaller files = more artifacts.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>90-100%</strong> — Near-original quality, minimal savings</li>
  <li><strong>80-90%</strong> — Sweet spot for most photos (recommended)</li>
  <li><strong>70-80%</strong> — Noticeable softness, but acceptable for thumbnails</li>
  <li><strong>Below 60%</strong> — Visible blocky artifacts, avoid for important images</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The trick: start at 80%, look at the result, adjust up if faces look weird.
</p>

<h2 id="resize">Resize before compressing</h2>
<p>
  This is the secret weapon. A 5000×3000 photo will be huge no matter the quality setting.
  If it's displayed at 1200px wide, resize to 2400px (2x for retina displays).
</p>
<p>
  Resizing often saves more than quality reduction and has zero visual impact.
</p>

<h2 id="metadata">Strip metadata (EXIF)</h2>
<p>
  Camera JPEGs include metadata: GPS coordinates, camera model, timestamps.
  This can add 50-200 KB per image. TinyUtils strips EXIF by default,
  which is also good for privacy.
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Batch compression</h2>
<p>
  Got 100 product photos? Don't compress them one by one.
  Drop the whole folder into TinyUtils, set quality once, and download a ZIP.
</p>

<h2 id="webp">Should you switch to WebP instead?</h2>
<p>
  WebP produces smaller files than JPEG at the same quality.
  If your users are on modern browsers (2020+), WebP is the better choice.
  You can convert JPEG → WebP in the same tool.

<h2 id="tools">Why not use Photoshop/GIMP?</h2>
<p>
  You can! But for quick batch compression:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No software to install</li>
  <li>Works on any device (including phones)</li>
  <li>Faster for simple "compress and go" workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For heavy editing, use your image editor. For compression, use a compressor.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Does compressing a JPEG multiple times reduce quality?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. Each re-compression introduces more artifacts.
  Always start from the original when possible.
</p>

<h3>What's the smallest I can make a JPEG?</h3>
<p>
  Depends on the image. A complex photo compresses less than a simple graphic.
  Resize + 80% quality is usually the practical minimum before visible degradation.
</p>

<h3>Can I compress JPEGs without losing quality?</h3>
<p>
  "Lossless" JPEG compression exists but offers minimal savings (10-20%).
  For real size reduction, you need lossy compression — but 80%+ quality is usually indistinguishable.
</p>

<h2 id="next">Next steps</h2>
<p>
  Time to shrink those JPEGs. Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>,
  drop your photos, and aim for "looks the same, half the size."
