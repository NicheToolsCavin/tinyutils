<p>
  WebP is the web's favorite format, but the rest of the world hasn't caught up.
  Need to upload to a platform that only takes JPEG? Sending images to someone using ancient software?
  Converting WebP to JPG solves that.
</p>
<p>
  Most people don’t choose WebP on purpose — they just download an image from a website and end up with a <code>.webp</code> file.
  The fix is simple: convert it to JPEG and move on with your life.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a> to convert WebP to JPEG.</li>
  <li>JPEG doesn't support transparency — transparent areas become white.</li>
  <li>If privacy matters: use a converter that runs locally in your browser (and verify in DevTools → Network).</li>
  <li>For photos, JPEG is a good universal format.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why convert WebP to JPEG?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Universal compatibility</strong> — Every device reads JPEG</li>
  <li><strong>Email attachments</strong> — Some email clients struggle with WebP</li>
  <li><strong>Print services</strong> — Many accept JPEG but not WebP</li>
  <li><strong>Legacy software</strong> — Older apps don't support WebP</li>
  <li><strong>Social media</strong> — Some platforms re-compress WebP anyway</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How to convert WebP to JPG</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your WebP files.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>JPEG</strong> as output format.</li>
  <li>Set quality (85-90% recommended for photos).</li>
  <li>Download the converted files.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="transparency">What happens to transparency?</h2>
<p>
  JPEG doesn't support transparency. If your WebP has a transparent background, it will become:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>White</strong> by default in most converters</li>
  <li><strong>Black</strong> in some tools</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you need transparency, convert to PNG instead of JPEG.
</p>

<h2 id="background">If transparency matters (pick your background on purpose)</h2>
<p>
  The “transparent → white background” thing is fine for most photos, but it can ruin logos and icons.
  If you need control over the background color, the safer workflow is:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Convert WebP → <a href="/blog/webp-to-png-converter/">PNG</a> (keep transparency).</li>
  <li>Open the PNG in an editor and export a JPEG with the background color you actually want.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  It’s one extra step, but it avoids the “why is my logo on a white box?” surprise.
</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality settings</h2>
<p>
  Since you're converting from one lossy format (WebP) to another (JPEG), use high quality to minimize additional degradation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>90-95%</strong> — Minimal additional quality loss</li>
  <li><strong>85%</strong> — Good balance of quality and file size</li>
  <li><strong>Below 80%</strong> — Noticeable artifacts may appear</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you’re converting something with sharp edges (logos, UI screenshots), JPEG is rarely the best choice. Use PNG instead — you’ll keep the edges clean.
</p>

<h2 id="size">File size expectations</h2>
<p>
  The output JPEG might be slightly larger or smaller than the input WebP, depending on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The original WebP quality setting</li>
  <li>The JPEG quality you choose</li>
  <li>Image content (photos vs graphics)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For typical photos, expect similar file sizes at equivalent quality levels.
</p>
<p>
  One gotcha: if the original WebP had transparency, JPEG has to flatten it against a background color. That can change both how it looks and how well it compresses.
</p>

<h2 id="office">Using the JPEG in Word/PowerPoint</h2>
<p>
  A lot of WebP → JPG conversions happen because Office apps (or older clients) are picky.
  If you’re dropping the image into a slide deck or a Word doc, use a fairly high quality setting (around 90%) so the next export (often another PDF) doesn’t double‑trash the image.
</p>
<p>
  Also: don’t rename a WebP file to <code>.jpg</code> and hope for the best. It won’t “convert” it — it just makes the filename lie.
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Batch conversion</h2>
<p>
  Converting multiple files? Drop them all into TinyUtils at once.
  The tool processes everything in parallel and provides a ZIP download.
</p>

<h2 id="privacy">Quick “no upload” sanity check</h2>
<p>
  If you care about privacy, don’t rely on vibes. Verify it:
  open DevTools → <strong>Network</strong>, convert one image, and make sure there’s no large upload request sending your file data to a server.
  (Normal page assets loading is expected.)
</p>

<h2 id="when-png">When to use PNG instead</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your WebP has transparency you want to keep</li>
  <li>It's a screenshot or graphic with sharp edges</li>
  <li>You need a lossless format for editing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is there quality loss when converting WebP to JPEG?</h3>
<p>
  Yes, some. You're going from one lossy format to another.
  Use 90%+ quality to minimize additional degradation.
</p>

<h3>JPG vs JPEG — what's the difference?</h3>
<p>
  Nothing. They're the same format. "JPG" is just the 3-letter extension from old Windows days.
  Use whichever you prefer.
</p>

<h3>Can I convert animated WebP to JPEG?</h3>
<p>
  JPEG doesn't support animation. You'll get only the first frame.
