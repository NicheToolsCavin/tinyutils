<p>
  WebP is the web's favorite format, but the rest of the world hasn't caught up.
  Need to upload to a platform that only takes JPEG? Sending images to someone using ancient software?
  Converting WebP to JPG solves that.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a> to convert WebP to JPEG.</li>
  <li>JPEG doesn't support transparency — transparent areas become white.</li>
  <li>Conversion happens in your browser, no upload needed.</li>
  <li>For photos, JPEG is a good universal format.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why convert WebP to JPEG?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Universal compatibility</strong> — Every device reads JPEG</li>
  <li><strong>Email attachments</strong> — Some email clients struggle with WebP</li>
  <li><strong>Print services</strong> — Many accept JPEG but not WebP</li>
  <li><strong>Legacy software</strong> — Older apps don't support WebP</li>
  <li><strong>Social media</strong> — Some platforms re-compress WebP anyway</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How to convert WebP to JPG</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your WebP files.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>JPEG</strong> as output format.</li>
  <li>Set quality (85-90% recommended for photos).</li>
  <li>Download the converted files.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="transparency">What happens to transparency?</h2>
<p>
  JPEG doesn't support transparency. If your WebP has a transparent background, it will become:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>White</strong> by default in most converters</li>
  <li><strong>Black</strong> in some tools</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you need transparency, convert to PNG instead of JPEG.
</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality settings</h2>
<p>
  Since you're converting from one lossy format (WebP) to another (JPEG), use high quality to minimize additional degradation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>90-95%</strong> — Minimal additional quality loss</li>
  <li><strong>85%</strong> — Good balance of quality and file size</li>
  <li><strong>Below 80%</strong> — Noticeable artifacts may appear</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="size">File size expectations</h2>
<p>
  The output JPEG might be slightly larger or smaller than the input WebP, depending on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The original WebP quality setting</li>
  <li>The JPEG quality you choose</li>
  <li>Image content (photos vs graphics)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For typical photos, expect similar file sizes at equivalent quality levels.
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Batch conversion</h2>
<p>
  Converting multiple files? Drop them all into TinyUtils at once.
  The tool processes everything in parallel and provides a ZIP download.
</p>

<h2 id="when-png">When to use PNG instead</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your WebP has transparency you want to keep</li>
  <li>It's a screenshot or graphic with sharp edges</li>
  <li>You need a lossless format for editing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is there quality loss when converting WebP to JPEG?</h3>
<p>
  Yes, some. You're going from one lossy format to another.
  Use 90%+ quality to minimize additional degradation.
</p>

<h3>JPG vs JPEG — what's the difference?</h3>
<p>
  Nothing. They're the same format. "JPG" is just the 3-letter extension from old Windows days.
  Use whichever you prefer.
</p>

<h3>Can I convert animated WebP to JPEG?</h3>
<p>
  JPEG doesn't support animation. You'll get only the first frame.
