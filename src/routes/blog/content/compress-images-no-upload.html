  “Compress images” sounds like a boring chore until you’re staring at a 14 MB PNG wondering why your page feels like dial‑up.
  Or you’re trying to email a client and Gmail is like: <em>nope</em>.
</p>

<p>
  The good news: you can compress images <strong>without uploading them to a server</strong>.
  That’s useful for privacy (personal photos, client work, NDA stuff) and it’s often faster because there’s no round trip.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you just want to compress quickly in your browser, use
    <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Photos:</strong> use JPEG or WebP.</li>
  <li><strong>Graphics with transparency:</strong> use PNG or WebP.</li>
  <li><strong>For websites:</strong> WebP is usually the best default in 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what">What “no upload” actually means</h2>
<p>
  Some tools say “no upload” but still send your files to a server.
  The real “no upload” version is <strong>client-side processing</strong>:
  the compression happens inside your browser, and the file never leaves your device.
</p>

<p>
  TinyUtils Image Compressor is built for that: it runs in your browser and doesn’t require an account.
</p>

<h2 id="steps">How to compress images without uploading</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drag and drop your images (you can batch a bunch at once).
  </li>
  <li>
    Pick an output format:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep</strong> (same format) if you mainly want resizing or a small quality tweak</li>
      <li><strong>WebP</strong> for the best “smaller file, looks good” default</li>
      <li><strong>JPEG</strong> for compatibility and photos</li>
      <li><strong>PNG</strong> for transparency and crisp UI</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Adjust quality (for JPEG/WebP) and optional resize settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Download the results (single files or a ZIP for batches).
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="format">JPEG vs PNG vs WebP (quick guide)</h2>

<h3>Use JPEG when…</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It’s a photo (especially lots of colors / gradients).</li>
  <li>You need maximum compatibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use PNG when…</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You need transparency.</li>
  <li>It’s UI (icons, sharp edges, screenshots) and JPEG artifacts look awful.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use WebP when…</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You’re optimizing for the web in 2025.</li>
  <li>You want smaller files without the “why does this look crunchy?” problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quality">Quality settings that usually work</h2>
<p>
  There’s no perfect number because every image is different.
  But if you want a starting point:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Photos:</strong> start around <code>0.80</code> quality for WebP/JPEG, then nudge down if needed.</li>
  <li><strong>UI screenshots:</strong> keep quality higher, or consider PNG/WebP “keep crisp edges”.</li>
  <li><strong>Huge images:</strong> resizing often saves more than quality tweaks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="resize">The “secret weapon” is resizing</h2>
<p>
  A lot of “my image is massive” problems are really “my image is 4000px wide and I display it at 900px.”
  If the image is going on a website, set a sensible max width.
  Your users (and your bandwidth bill) will thank you.
</p>

<h2 id="gotchas">Common gotchas (so you don’t rage-quit)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Transparency → JPEG:</strong> JPEG doesn’t support transparency.
    If you convert a transparent PNG to JPEG, you’ll get a background.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Over-compression:</strong> if faces look like watercolor, bump quality up a bit.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>“It’s still big”:</strong> check dimensions. A 6000×4000 image will be big even at low quality.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="seo">SEO note: why this matters for rankings</h2>
<p>
  Image weight affects page speed.
  Page speed affects user behavior.
  User behavior affects everything.
  So while “compress images” isn’t magic SEO fairy dust, it’s one of the easiest high‑impact technical wins.

  “looks the same, smaller file.”
  That’s the whole game.
