  WebP is great for the web, but sometimes you need a PNG.
  Maybe you're uploading to a platform that doesn't support WebP.
  Maybe you need to edit the image in software that chokes on WebP.
  Maybe you just want transparency in a format everything understands.
</p>

<p>
  Converting WebP to PNG is quick and free — here's how.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a> to convert WebP to PNG.</li>
  <li>PNG files will be larger than the original WebP (that's expected).</li>
  <li>Transparency is preserved during conversion.</li>
  <li>If privacy matters: use a converter that runs locally in your browser (and verify in DevTools → Network).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why convert WebP to PNG?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Compatibility</strong> — Some apps/platforms don't support WebP</li>
  <li><strong>Editing</strong> — PNG is universally supported in image editors</li>
  <li><strong>Printing</strong> — Print services often prefer PNG or TIFF</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — Need an editable file with alpha channel</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-not">When PNG isn’t the right target</h2>
<p>
  PNG is fantastic for logos, UI, and anything that needs transparency.
  It’s not always the best choice for photos.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>If it’s a photo:</strong> JPEG is usually smaller and widely accepted.
    Try <a href="/blog/webp-to-jpg-converter/">WebP → JPG</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>If you’re converting just to upload to the web:</strong> see if the platform accepts WebP first.
    Plenty do now, and you’ll keep the smaller file.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>If you need transparency:</strong> PNG is the safe choice.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How to convert WebP to PNG</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your WebP files.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>PNG</strong> as output format.</li>
  <li>Download the converted files.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  That's it. No quality slider needed — PNG is lossless.
</p>

<h2 id="privacy">Quick “no upload” sanity check</h2>
<p>
  “No upload” should mean your file data never leaves your device.
  If you want to verify: open DevTools → <strong>Network</strong>, convert one file, and look for any large <code>POST</code> requests.
  You’ll still see normal requests for the website itself — you’re checking for image data uploads.
</p>

<h2 id="size">Why is my PNG bigger than the WebP?</h2>
<p>
  This is normal and expected. WebP uses lossy compression (by default), while PNG is lossless.
  When you convert, the PNG preserves all the pixels from the WebP exactly — but without the compression tricks that made WebP small.
</p>
<p>
  Think of it like this: compressing a sponge (WebP), then putting it in a rigid box (PNG).
  The box is bigger because it can't squeeze.
</p>

<h2 id="transparency">Does transparency survive?</h2>
<p>
  Yes! Both WebP and PNG support transparency.
  Converting between them preserves the alpha channel perfectly.
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Batch conversion</h2>
<p>
  Got a folder of WebP files? Drop them all into TinyUtils.
  Select PNG output, and download a ZIP with all the converted files.
</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality considerations</h2>
<p>
  You can't "recover" quality lost during WebP compression.
  If the original WebP was saved at 70% quality, the PNG will have the same artifacts — just in a different container.
</p>
<p>
  For best results, start with high-quality WebP files (85%+) if you know you'll need to convert later.
</p>

<h2 id="weird">If the PNG looks worse than expected</h2>
<p>
  This surprises people: converting to PNG doesn’t magically “restore” detail. It can only preserve what’s already in the WebP.
  A few common gotchas:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blocky/shimmery areas:</strong> the WebP was saved at a low quality and the artifacts are baked in.</li>
  <li><strong>Halo around cutouts:</strong> the WebP might have been flattened against a background before you got it.</li>
  <li><strong>Text looks crunchy:</strong> if it’s a screenshot or UI, try to find the original PNG/SVG instead of converting.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alternatives">When to use JPEG instead</h2>
<p>
  If you're converting for compatibility and don't need transparency, JPEG might be a better choice.
  JPEG files are smaller than PNG for photos.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Need transparency?</strong> → PNG</li>
  <li><strong>Photo without transparency?</strong> → JPEG might be smaller</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Can I convert PNG back to WebP later?</h3>
<p>
  Yes, but each conversion can introduce slight changes.
  If you're going round-trip, expect some quality degradation over multiple conversions.
</p>

<h3>Is WebP to PNG lossless?</h3>
<p>
  The conversion itself is lossless — PNG preserves exactly what was in the WebP.
  But if the WebP was lossy, those artifacts are now "baked in."
</p>

<h3>What about animated WebP?</h3>
<p>
  Animated WebP → PNG gives you the first frame only.
  For animations, you'd need to convert to GIF or extract all frames.

<h2 id="next">Next steps</h2>
<p>
  Need to convert WebP to PNG? Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>,
  drop in your files, and get PNG versions in seconds.
</p>
<p>
  One small workflow tip: keep the original WebP if you’re going to publish it back to the web.
  Use the PNG for editing, then export a fresh WebP/JPEG for shipping.
