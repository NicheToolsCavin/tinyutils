  PDFs are fixed-page documents. HTML is what the web is made of. If you need a PDF’s content to behave like a normal web page — readable on mobile, linkable, searchable, and easier to copy — converting to HTML can be simpler than embedding a PDF viewer. Just plan to QA the output, especially around headings, tables, and spacing.

<h2 id="understanding-formats">Understanding PDF and HTML</h2>

<h3>What is PDF?</h3>
<p>
  PDF (Portable Document Format) preserves documents exactly as created—fixed pages with precise positioning of every element. This fidelity makes PDF perfect for printing and sharing documents that must look identical everywhere. But fixed layouts don't adapt to different screen sizes, and PDF content isn't naturally part of the web.
</p>

<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
<p>
  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the native language of the web. HTML content reflows to fit any screen, works with CSS for styling, and integrates with JavaScript for interactivity. Search engines index HTML content directly. Screen readers parse HTML for accessibility. HTML is how the web works.
</p>

<h2 id="why">Why Convert PDF to HTML?</h2>

<h3>1. Web Publishing</h3>
<p>
  Put PDF content online as native web pages rather than embedded viewers. HTML loads faster, works on all devices, and integrates with your site's navigation and design.
</p>

<h3>2. Search Engine Optimization</h3>
<p>
  PDFs can be indexed, but HTML is usually easier to integrate into a site: titles, internal links, structured headings, navigation, and styling. If SEO matters, an HTML version is often the safer bet.
</p>

<h3>3. Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  HTML is inherently more accessible than PDF. Screen readers work naturally with HTML structure. Users can zoom, change colors, and adjust text without losing functionality.
</p>

<h3>4. Responsive Design</h3>
<p>
  HTML reflows to fit any screen—phones, tablets, desktops. PDFs often force users to zoom and scroll on mobile. Convert if you want the content to feel native on smaller screens.
</p>

<h3>5. Content Editing</h3>
<p>
  HTML is easy to edit with any text editor or CMS. PDF editing requires specialized software. Convert when you need to modify content.
</p>

<h3>6. Integration</h3>
<p>
  HTML integrates with websites, email templates, apps, and web-based systems. PDF requires special handling. HTML drops into existing workflows.
</p>

<h2 id="after-conversion">After Conversion</h2>
<p>
  Common post-conversion tasks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Add CSS styling:</strong> The HTML is semantic but unstyled—add your design</li>
  <li><strong>Fix line breaks:</strong> PDF line breaks may need paragraph merging</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust images:</strong> Position and size images for web layout</li>
  <li><strong>Add semantic tags:</strong> Enhance with nav, article, section elements</li>
  <li><strong>Integrate navigation:</strong> Add to your site's menu structure</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-cases">Common Use Cases</h2>

<h3>Document Libraries</h3>
<p>
  Convert PDF documentation to searchable HTML pages. Users find content through site search instead of downloading and searching within PDFs.
</p>

<h3>Knowledge Bases</h3>
<p>
  Transform PDF manuals and guides into web-based knowledge bases with proper navigation, search, and cross-linking.
</p>

<h3>Content Migration</h3>
<p>
  Moving content from PDF archives to a modern CMS? Convert to HTML as an intermediate step for easier import.
</p>

<h3>Email Content</h3>
<p>
  Extract content from PDF reports for email newsletters. HTML works in email clients; PDF attachments often go unread.
</p>

<h3>Accessibility Compliance</h3>
<p>
  Many accessibility requirements are easier to meet with HTML than PDF. Convert for better compliance with WCAG and Section 508.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Will the HTML look exactly like the PDF?</h3>
<p>
  No—and that's often the point. PDF and HTML are fundamentally different. Content transfers, but layout adapts to HTML's flexible nature.
</p>

<h3>What about images in the PDF?</h3>
<p>
  Images are extracted and saved separately. The HTML references them with img tags. You'll receive both the HTML and image files.
</p>

<h3>Can I convert a scanned PDF?</h3>
<p>
  Scanned PDFs contain images of pages, not text. They need OCR processing first to create a text layer, then conversion to HTML.
</p>

<h3>What about multi-page PDFs?</h3>
<p>
  Multi-page PDFs convert to a single HTML file with all content. Page breaks become section breaks in the HTML.
</p>

<h3>What's the maximum file size?</h3>
<p>
  The converter handles PDFs up to 50MB. Large files with many images may take longer to process.
