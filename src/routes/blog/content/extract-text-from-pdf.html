<p>
  PDFs are designed to preserve formatting, not to share editable content. When you need the actual text from a PDF—for analysis, editing, translation, data processing, or any other purpose—you need to extract it. The approach depends on what kind of PDF you have: digital PDFs created from text sources extract easily; scanned PDFs (images of documents) require OCR. Here's the complete guide to getting text out of PDFs.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Digital PDFs: Use <a href="/tools/text-converter/">TinyUtils Document Converter</a> → Plain Text output</li>
  <li>Scanned PDFs: Need OCR (optical character recognition) first</li>
  <li>Quick test: Can you select text in the PDF? If yes, it's digital and extracts easily</li>
  <li>Tables and formatting: May need cleanup after extraction</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="types">Understanding PDF Types</h2>

<h3>Digital PDFs (Easy to Extract)</h3>
<p>
  Digital PDFs contain actual text data. They're created when you export from Word, save a webpage as PDF, use "Print to PDF," or create a PDF from any text source. The text is stored as character data—the same way your word processor stores it.
</p>
<p>
  Characteristics of digital PDFs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can select individual words and sentences</li>
  <li>Copy-paste works</li>
  <li>You can search within the document (Ctrl/Cmd+F)</li>
  <li>File size is typically smaller than image-based PDFs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scanned PDFs (Requires OCR)</h3>
<p>
  Scanned PDFs are essentially images wrapped in a PDF container. They're created by scanning paper documents or photographing pages. What looks like text is actually pixels—there's no underlying text data.
</p>
<p>
  Characteristics of scanned PDFs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can only select the entire page as an image</li>
  <li>Copy-paste doesn't work for text</li>
  <li>Search doesn't find words in the document</li>
  <li>File size is often larger (image data is bulky)</li>
  <li>Zoom reveals pixelation rather than crisp text</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hybrid PDFs</h3>
<p>
  Some PDFs contain both digital text and scanned images. OCR may have been applied to some pages but not others. Test multiple pages to understand what you're working with.
</p>

<h2 id="test">How to Tell What Type You Have</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open the PDF in any viewer</li>
  <li>Try to select text by clicking and dragging</li>
  <li>If you can highlight individual words → Digital (easy extraction)</li>
  <li>If you can only select the whole page as one block → Scanned (needs OCR)</li>
  <li>Try Ctrl/Cmd+F and search for a visible word</li>
  <li>If the search works → Digital</li>
  <li>If "no matches found" for visible text → Scanned</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="digital">Extracting Text from Digital PDFs</h2>

<h3>Using TinyUtils Document Converter</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <a href="/tools/text-converter/">TinyUtils Document Converter</a></li>
  <li>Upload your PDF file</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Plain Text</strong> as the output format</li>
  <li>Click Convert</li>
  <li>Download the .txt file containing all extracted text</li>
</ol>

<h3>Output Formats</h3>
<p>
  Plain text isn't your only option. Depending on what you need:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plain Text (.txt):</strong> Just the text, no formatting</li>
  <li><strong>Markdown (.md):</strong> Preserves some structure (headings, lists)</li>
  <li><strong>HTML (.html):</strong> Keeps more formatting as HTML tags</li>
  <li><strong>DOCX (.docx):</strong> Editable Word document with formatting</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Gets Extracted</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All text content from all pages</li>
  <li>Text reading order (as best as the PDF structure allows)</li>
  <li>Paragraph breaks (usually)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What May Be Lost</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Precise formatting (fonts, sizes, colors)</li>
  <li>Page layout (columns become linear text)</li>
  <li>Tables (become separated text)</li>
  <li>Headers and footers (mixed into content)</li>
  <li>Images (not extracted to plain text)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scanned">Extracting Text from Scanned PDFs</h2>
<p>
  Scanned PDFs require Optical Character Recognition (OCR)—technology that "reads" images of text and converts them to actual text data.
</p>

<h3>OCR Process</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The OCR software analyzes each page image</li>
  <li>It identifies letter shapes and patterns</li>
  <li>It converts recognized shapes to text characters</li>
  <li>The text is output for your use</li>
</ol>

<h3>OCR Options</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Docs:</strong> Upload a PDF to Google Drive, open with Google Docs—it runs OCR automatically</li>
  <li><strong>Adobe Acrobat:</strong> Built-in OCR in the Pro version</li>
  <li><strong>Online OCR services:</strong> Various web-based tools</li>
  <li><strong>Desktop software:</strong> ABBYY FineReader, OmniPage, and others</li>
</ul>

<h3>OCR Accuracy Factors</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Image quality:</strong> Clear scans produce better results</li>
  <li><strong>Font types:</strong> Standard fonts are recognized better than unusual ones</li>
  <li><strong>Document condition:</strong> Faded, wrinkled, or damaged documents reduce accuracy</li>
  <li><strong>Language:</strong> OCR works best for languages it's trained on</li>
  <li><strong>Layout complexity:</strong> Simple layouts extract better than complex multi-column designs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tables">Extracting Tables</h2>
<p>
  Tables are challenging to extract because PDF stores table data as positioned text, not structured data. The relationship between cells isn't explicitly preserved.
</p>

<h3>Table Extraction Approaches</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Convert to DOCX first:</strong> Word does better at reconstructing tables</li>
  <li><strong>Specialized table extractors:</strong> Some tools specifically target PDF tables</li>
  <li><strong>Manual cleanup:</strong> Often necessary for complex tables</li>
  <li><strong>PDF to Excel/CSV tools:</strong> For data-heavy documents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Better Table Extraction</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Convert to DOCX rather than plain text</li>
  <li>Check the table structure in the result</li>
  <li>Be prepared for manual adjustment</li>
  <li>For critical data, verify against the original</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="common">Common Extraction Issues</h2>

<h3>Weird Line Breaks</h3>
<p>
  PDFs store text line-by-line as it appears on the page. A paragraph may have breaks mid-sentence wherever the original line wrapped. Fix with find-and-replace: search for single line breaks within paragraphs.
</p>

<h3>Missing Text</h3>
<p>
  Some PDFs use images for headings, logos, or styled text. These won't extract as text. If visible text isn't in your output, it's probably an image in the original.
</p>

<h3>Garbled Characters</h3>
<p>
  Custom fonts or encoding issues can produce incorrect characters. The PDF might use non-standard character mappings. Try a different extraction method or tool—different tools handle encoding differently.
</p>

<h3>Wrong Reading Order</h3>
<p>
  Multi-column layouts sometimes extract with columns interleaved incorrectly. The tool reads left-to-right when it should follow column boundaries. Manual reordering may be necessary.
</p>

<h3>Headers and Footers Mixed In</h3>
<p>
  Page numbers, headers, and footers extract as content on every page. You'll need to clean these out if they interrupt your main text.
</p>

<h2 id="use-cases">Common Use Cases</h2>

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
<p>
  Extract text for natural language processing, sentiment analysis, or content analysis. Plain text is the input format most analysis tools expect.
</p>

<h3>Content Editing</h3>
<p>
  Turn static PDFs back into editable content. Extract, edit in your preferred word processor, then recreate the PDF or publish in a new format.
</p>

<h3>Translation</h3>
<p>
  Translation tools work better with extracted text than with PDFs directly. Extract, translate, then reformat as needed.
</p>

<h3>Search and Indexing</h3>
<p>
  Make PDF contents searchable by extracting text for your search system. Document management systems often need this for full-text search.
</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  Extract text to provide accessible alternatives to PDFs. Screen readers work better with plain text than with poorly-tagged PDFs.
</p>

<h3>Quotation and Citation</h3>
<p>
  Extract specific passages for quoting in your own work. Cleaner than copy-pasting from a PDF viewer, which often introduces formatting issues.
</p>

<h2 id="preserving-structure">Preserving Structure</h2>

<h3>Markdown Output</h3>
<p>
  For documents with clear structure (headings, lists, emphasis), Markdown output preserves more than plain text:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Headings become # Heading markers</li>
  <li>Bold and italic are preserved</li>
  <li>Lists maintain their structure</li>
  <li>Links remain clickable</li>
</ul>

<h3>DOCX Output</h3>
<p>
  For maximum structure preservation, convert to DOCX:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tables attempt to reconstruct</li>
  <li>Formatting is preserved where possible</li>
  <li>You can edit in Word or compatible software</li>
  <li>Further export to other formats from Word</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I extract text from a password-protected PDF?</h3>
<p>
  Depends on the protection type. Some "protected" PDFs allow reading but prevent editing—these often extract fine. Fully encrypted PDFs require the password first. Some tools can extract from read-only PDFs; none can bypass full encryption.
</p>

<h3>Will formatting be preserved?</h3>
<p>
  Plain text has no formatting. For formatted output, convert to DOCX or HTML instead, which preserve more structure.
</p>

<h3>Can I extract text from a specific page only?</h3>
<p>
  Most converters extract the entire document. Extract everything, then take the portion you need. For single-page extraction, some PDF editors can export individual pages first.
</p>

<h3>Why is some text appearing as symbols?</h3>
<p>
  Custom fonts or encoding issues. The PDF uses non-standard character mappings. Try a different extraction tool, or try converting to DOCX first.
</p>

<h3>Can I extract text from a PDF on my phone?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. Web-based converters work on mobile browsers. Upload your PDF, convert to text, download the result.
</p>

<h3>Is there a maximum file size?</h3>
<p>
  Most converters have size limits—typically 50-100MB. Very large PDFs may need desktop software.
</p>
