<p>
  iPhone photos are saved in HEIC format to save space, but most apps, websites, and design tools
  expect PNG. Here's how to convert HEIC to PNG without uploading your photos anywhere.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a></li>
  <li>Drop your HEIC files (batch supported)</li>
  <li>Select <strong>PNG</strong> as output format</li>
  <li>Download individual files or ZIP</li>
  <li>If privacy matters: use a converter that can run locally in your browser (and verify in DevTools → Network)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-png">Why convert to PNG?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Universal support</strong> — Every browser, app, and OS reads PNG</li>
  <li><strong>Lossless quality</strong> — No compression artifacts</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — Alpha channel preserved if present</li>
  <li><strong>Editing</strong> — Better for Photoshop, Figma, Canva workflows</li>
  <li><strong>Print</strong> — Higher quality for physical prints</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-not">When PNG is the wrong target</h2>
<p>
  If this is just a normal iPhone photo and you’re converting it so someone can open it,
  PNG is usually overkill. PNG is lossless, which means it can get <em>big</em> fast.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Sending a photo to a human?</strong>
    Use <a href="/blog/heic-to-jpg-converter/">HEIC → JPG</a> (smaller, compatible, good enough).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Uploading photos to a website?</strong>
    Use <a href="/blog/convert-heic-to-webp/">HEIC → WebP</a> (usually smaller than JPG).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Need crisp edges or transparency?</strong>
    PNG makes sense (screenshots, UI assets, logos).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">How to convert HEIC to PNG</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a></li>
  <li>Drag your HEIC photos into the drop zone (or click to browse)</li>
  <li>Under <strong>Output Format</strong>, select <strong>PNG</strong></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Convert</strong></li>
  <li>Download each PNG individually or get all in a ZIP</li>
</ol>
<p>
  If you’re using a browser‑based converter like TinyUtils, the conversion can happen locally (client‑side).
  If that matters to you, do a quick check: open DevTools → <strong>Network</strong>, convert one file,
  and confirm there’s no giant upload request leaving your browser.
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Batch conversion</h2>
<p>
  Have a folder full of iPhone photos? Drop them all at once.
  TinyUtils processes files in parallel and packages everything into a single ZIP download.
</p>

<h2 id="avoid-future">Avoid future HEIC headaches</h2>
<p>
  If you keep tripping over HEIC, you can reduce how often you need to convert:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>New photos:</strong> iPhone Settings → Camera → Formats → choose <strong>Most Compatible</strong>
    (saves JPEG instead of HEIC; uses more storage).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Transfers to a computer:</strong> iPhone Settings → Photos → Transfer to Mac or PC → <strong>Automatic</strong>
    (iOS will convert on transfer in many cases).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You don’t <em>have</em> to change these — HEIC is fine when you control the workflow — but it saves you from surprise “unsupported format” errors.
</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HEIC is lossy</strong> — Original HEIC already has some compression</li>
  <li><strong>PNG is lossless</strong> — Conversion doesn't add more artifacts</li>
  <li><strong>File size</strong> — PNG files are larger than HEIC (no compression)</li>
  <li><strong>Metadata</strong> — many converters re‑encode images and may drop EXIF; keep originals if you need date/location data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="weird">If the converted PNG looks “off”</h2>
<p>
  Most of the time it’s fine. When it’s not, it’s usually one of these:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Colors look different on Windows:</strong>
    wide‑gamut photos (Display P3 / HDR) can look odd in some viewers. Try exporting as JPEG instead, or open in an editor and convert to sRGB.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>It got huge:</strong>
    that’s PNG doing PNG things. If you don’t need transparency, JPG/WebP is the practical option.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>It still looks “compressed”:</strong>
    the HEIC was already lossy, so those artifacts come along for the ride.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Do I need to install anything?</h3>
<p>
  No. TinyUtils runs in your browser. No software, no plugins.
</p>

<h3>Will my photos be uploaded?</h3>
<p>
  TinyUtils is designed to run this locally in your browser. If you want to be extra sure, verify it:
  open DevTools → Network and make sure there’s no big file upload request during conversion.
  (If you use other tools, read their privacy policy — “free converter” sites often upload by default.)
</p>

<h3>Can I convert HEIC from AirDrop?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. Just save the HEIC file to your computer first, then drop it into TinyUtils.
</p>

<h3>What about Live Photos?</h3>
<p>
  Only the still image portion converts. The video component is separate.
</p>

<h3>Why are my PNG files so large?</h3>
<p>
  PNG uses lossless compression, so files are bigger than HEIC.
  If file size matters more than perfect quality, use <a href="/blog/heic-to-jpg-converter/">HEIC to JPG</a> instead.

  If you find yourself converting HEIC every week, it’s worth revisiting the iPhone settings above.
  Converting is fine — but avoiding the problem at the source is even nicer.
