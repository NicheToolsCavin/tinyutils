  WebP is the format that makes web developers happy: smaller files, same quality, and yes — it supports transparency.
  Converting your PNGs to WebP is one of the easiest wins for page speed.
</p>

<p>
  The catch? You need a converter that actually works and doesn't require uploading your files to some random server.
  That's what we're solving here.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a> to convert PNG to WebP in your browser.</li>
  <li>WebP is often much smaller than PNG for the same “looks fine” result.</li>
  <li>WebP supports transparency (unlike JPEG).</li>
  <li>Modern browsers support WebP; for older browsers, serve PNG as a fallback.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why convert PNG to WebP?</h2>
<p>
  PNG is lossless, which is great for quality but terrible for file size.
  WebP uses smarter compression that produces much smaller files.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Smaller files</strong> — often dramatically smaller than equivalent PNG</li>
  <li><strong>Faster pages</strong> — less bandwidth, quicker loads</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — WebP keeps your alpha channel</li>
  <li><strong>Universal support</strong> — Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge all support it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How to convert PNG to WebP (free, no upload)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your PNG files.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>WebP</strong> as the output format.</li>
  <li>Adjust quality (85% is a good default).</li>
  <li>Click download — single file or ZIP for batches.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Browser‑based converters can do this locally (client‑side). If privacy matters, verify it:
  open DevTools → <strong>Network</strong>, convert one image, and confirm there’s no large upload request sending your file data to a server.
</p>

<h2 id="quality">What quality setting should I use?</h2>
<p>
  WebP quality is a bit different from JPEG quality. Here's a rough guide:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>90-100%</strong> — Near-lossless, minimal savings over PNG</li>
  <li><strong>80-90%</strong> — Sweet spot for most images</li>
  <li><strong>70-80%</strong> — Good for thumbnails and backgrounds</li>
  <li><strong>Below 70%</strong> — Visible artifacts, use only if size is critical</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transparency">Does WebP keep transparency?</h2>
<p>
  Yes! Unlike JPEG, WebP supports alpha channels (transparency).
  Your PNG with a transparent background will convert cleanly to WebP with the same transparency.
</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">Browser compatibility</h2>
<p>
  WebP is supported by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chrome</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Safari (recent versions)</li>
  <li>Edge</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The main holdouts are older browsers (think IE11-era). For those, you can serve PNG as a fallback using the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element.
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Batch conversion</h2>
<p>
  Got a folder of PNGs? Drop them all into TinyUtils at once.
  The tool processes them in parallel and gives you a ZIP download.
</p>

<h2 id="serve">How to serve WebP with a safe fallback</h2>
<p>
  If you’re using WebP on a website and you want maximum compatibility, don’t make it an all-or-nothing switch.
  Use <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> so older browsers still get PNG:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;picture&gt;
  &lt;source srcset=\"logo.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"&gt;
  &lt;img src=\"logo.png\" alt=\"Logo\"&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  If you’re self-hosting files, make sure your server sends the right MIME type for WebP (<code>image/webp</code>).
  Otherwise some browsers will treat it as “a download” instead of displaying it, which is… not the vibe.
</p>

<h2 id="results">What to expect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Big wins:</strong> photos and complex graphics usually shrink a lot.</li>
  <li><strong>Smaller wins:</strong> tiny icons and already‑optimized PNGs won’t move as much.</li>
  <li><strong>Best win of all:</strong> resizing an oversized PNG before you convert.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  One workflow that stays sane: keep the original PNG as your “source” (especially for logos and UI assets),
  and generate WebP only for shipping. That way you’re never editing a lossy file, and you can re-export cleanly later.
</p>

<h2 id="vs-avif">WebP vs AVIF: which is better?</h2>
<p>
  AVIF is newer and often produces even smaller files.
  Browser support is improving, but it’s not universal everywhere (especially on older devices).
  WebP is the boring “works basically everywhere” choice. If you want to serve AVIF too, use a <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> fallback so older browsers still get WebP/PNG.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Can I convert WebP back to PNG?</h3>
<p>
  Yes, but you won't get the original quality back.
  WebP is lossy (at most quality levels), so converting back creates a larger file from already-compressed data.
</p>

<h3>Is PNG to WebP conversion lossless?</h3>
<p>
  Not by default. WebP uses lossy compression for smaller files.
  WebP does have a lossless mode, but the savings are smaller (similar to PNG-to-PNG optimization).
</p>

<h3>Should I replace all my PNGs with WebP?</h3>
<p>
  For web use, yes. For archival or editing, keep the original PNGs.
</p>

<h2 id="next">Next steps</h2>
<p>
  Ready to convert? Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>,
  drop in your PNGs, select WebP, and compare the results side by side.
</p>
<p>
  Keep the original PNGs somewhere safe.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re publishing on the web, remember to actually serve the WebP files (or use <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> with fallbacks). Converting is easy; shipping the right file is the win.
