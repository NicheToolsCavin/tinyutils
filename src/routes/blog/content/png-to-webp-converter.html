  WebP is the format that makes web developers happy: smaller files, same quality, and yes — it supports transparency.
  Converting your PNGs to WebP is one of the easiest wins for page speed.
</p>

<p>
  The catch? You need a converter that actually works and doesn't require uploading your files to some random server.
  That's what we're solving here.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a> to convert PNG to WebP in your browser.</li>
  <li>WebP is typically 50-80% smaller than PNG at similar quality.</li>
  <li>WebP supports transparency (unlike JPEG).</li>
  <li>All modern browsers support WebP (Safari since 2020, everything else earlier).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why convert PNG to WebP?</h2>
<p>
  PNG is lossless, which is great for quality but terrible for file size.
  WebP uses smarter compression that produces much smaller files.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Smaller files</strong> — 50-80% smaller than equivalent PNG</li>
  <li><strong>Faster pages</strong> — less bandwidth, quicker loads</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — WebP keeps your alpha channel</li>
  <li><strong>Universal support</strong> — Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge all support it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How to convert PNG to WebP (free, no upload)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your PNG files.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>WebP</strong> as the output format.</li>
  <li>Adjust quality (85% is a good default).</li>
  <li>Click download — single file or ZIP for batches.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Everything happens in your browser. No upload, no account, no waiting.
</p>

<h2 id="quality">What quality setting should I use?</h2>
<p>
  WebP quality is a bit different from JPEG quality. Here's a rough guide:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>90-100%</strong> — Near-lossless, minimal savings over PNG</li>
  <li><strong>80-90%</strong> — Sweet spot for most images</li>
  <li><strong>70-80%</strong> — Good for thumbnails and backgrounds</li>
  <li><strong>Below 70%</strong> — Visible artifacts, use only if size is critical</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transparency">Does WebP keep transparency?</h2>
<p>
  Yes! Unlike JPEG, WebP supports alpha channels (transparency).
  Your PNG with a transparent background will convert cleanly to WebP with the same transparency.
</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">Browser compatibility in 2025</h2>
<p>
  WebP is supported by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chrome (since 2014)</li>
  <li>Firefox (since 2019)</li>
  <li>Safari (since 2020 — macOS Big Sur / iOS 14)</li>
  <li>Edge (since forever, it's Chromium)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The only holdouts are ancient browsers (IE11, old Safari).
  For those edge cases, you can serve PNG as a fallback using the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element.

  Got a folder of PNGs? Drop them all into TinyUtils at once.
  The tool processes them in parallel and gives you a ZIP download.

<h2 id="vs-avif">WebP vs AVIF: which is better?</h2>
<p>
  AVIF is newer and often produces even smaller files.
  But browser support is still catching up (no Safari until late 2023).
  For now, WebP is the safe choice. AVIF support is coming to TinyUtils soon.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Can I convert WebP back to PNG?</h3>
<p>
  Yes, but you won't get the original quality back.
  WebP is lossy (at most quality levels), so converting back creates a larger file from already-compressed data.
</p>

<h3>Is PNG to WebP conversion lossless?</h3>
<p>
  Not by default. WebP uses lossy compression for smaller files.
  WebP does have a lossless mode, but the savings are smaller (similar to PNG-to-PNG optimization).
</p>

<h3>Should I replace all my PNGs with WebP?</h3>
<p>
  For web use, yes. For archival or editing, keep the original PNGs.
