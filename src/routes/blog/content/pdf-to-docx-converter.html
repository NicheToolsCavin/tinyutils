  PDFs are great for “here’s the final version.” They’re not great for “can you fix two lines and send it back by 5pm?”
  If you need to actually edit what’s inside a PDF, converting it to a Word document (DOCX) is usually the least painful move.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/text-converter/">TinyUtils Document Converter</a></li>
  <li>Upload your PDF</li>
  <li>Select <strong>DOCX</strong> as output</li>
  <li>Download the Word document</li>
  <li>Edit as needed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="before-you-convert">Before you convert: is it a real PDF, or a scan?</h2>
<p>
  Quick test: open the PDF and try to select a sentence with your mouse. If you can highlight text, you’re in decent shape.
  If you can’t select anything (or you only select “blocks”), it’s probably a scanned document — basically a set of images —
  and you’ll need OCR before any converter can give you editable text.
</p>
<p>
  Another quick clue: if it’s a fillable form, expect extra weirdness. Form fields often flatten into awkward tables or positioned text.
  Sometimes the fastest solution is rebuilding the form in Word instead of trying to preserve the exact layout.
</p>

<h2 id="why">Why convert PDF to Word?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Edit content</strong> — Fix typos, update info</li>
  <li><strong>Extract text</strong> — Copy-paste doesn't preserve formatting</li>
  <li><strong>Reuse templates</strong> — Turn a PDF back into a working doc</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborate</strong> — Track Changes works in Word, not PDF</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> — Word has better screen reader support</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reality">Expectations vs. reality</h2>
<p>
  PDF to Word isn’t perfect, because PDFs don’t store “this is a heading” or “this is a table.” They store “draw this text
  at this coordinate.” The converter has to guess the structure. It usually gets you most of the way there, but expect a little cleanup.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Text</strong> — Usually accurate</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraphs</strong> — Mostly preserved</li>
  <li><strong>Tables</strong> — Reconstructed (may need cleanup)</li>
  <li><strong>Images</strong> — Extracted and placed</li>
  <li><strong>Exact layout</strong> — Close but not pixel-perfect</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="good">Works well for</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Text-heavy documents (reports, contracts)</li>
  <li>Simple layouts (single column)</li>
  <li>Documents originally created in Word</li>
  <li>Standard fonts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hard">Harder cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Complex multi-column layouts</li>
  <li>Scanned documents (no selectable text)</li>
  <li>Heavy graphics and charts</li>
  <li>Forms with input fields</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">How to convert</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="/tools/text-converter/">TinyUtils Document Converter</a></li>
  <li>Upload your PDF</li>
  <li>Select <strong>DOCX</strong> from output options</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Convert</strong></li>
  <li>Download and open in Word</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="scanned">Scanned PDFs</h2>
<p>
  If your PDF is a scanned image (no selectable text), you need OCR first. A converter can’t “read” text that isn’t there —
  it can only extract the text layer the PDF already contains.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re not sure where to start, here are a few common OCR paths:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Adobe Acrobat OCR</strong> (paid, usually good).</li>
  <li><strong>Google Drive OCR</strong> (upload → open with Google Docs; quality varies).</li>
  <li><strong>Phone scan apps</strong> that bake in text (useful for quick paperwork).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you have a text-based PDF (or a DOCX from the OCR step), the conversion becomes dramatically less painful.
</p>

<h2 id="cleanup">After conversion</h2>
<p>
  Common cleanup tasks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix line breaks within paragraphs</li>
  <li>Adjust table column widths</li>
  <li>Reapply heading styles</li>
  <li>Reposition images</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Two specific fixes that come up a lot:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Repeated headers/footers:</strong> if every page title becomes a line in the middle of your doc, delete one and then search for the pattern.</li>
  <li><strong>Hyphenation:</strong> PDFs often split words at line ends (<code>docu-</code> + <code>ment</code>). A quick find/replace can clean it up.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Still faster than retyping the whole document.
</p>
<p>
  One underrated option: if you don’t care about the original layout, convert/extract to plain text and paste it into a clean Word template.
  You lose “looks like the PDF,” but you gain a document that’s easy to edit.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Will the Word doc look exactly like the PDF?</h3>
<p>
  Sometimes it’s surprisingly close. Sometimes it’s a bit of a mess — especially with multi‑column layouts, complex tables, or forms.
  Treat the DOCX as an editable draft you can fix, not a pixel‑perfect clone of the PDF.
</p>

<h3>Can I convert password-protected PDFs?</h3>
<p>
  You need to unlock the PDF first. Protected PDFs can't be read.
</p>

<h3>What about fillable form fields?</h3>
<p>
  Form fields are flattened. The text is preserved but not as editable fields.
</p>

<h3>Is the conversion private?</h3>
<p>
  TinyUtils needs to process your file to create the output. For the details (what we store, logs, retention), see our
  <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy policy</a> and <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a>.
