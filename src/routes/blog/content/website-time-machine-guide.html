<p>
  The web forgets. Sites disappear, pages change, content gets deleted. But the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine remembers. Since 1996, it has been archiving the web—saving snapshots of pages so you can see what any website looked like at various points in history. Whether you're researching how sites evolved, recovering lost content, or verifying what a page actually said at a specific time, the Wayback Machine is your time machine for the internet.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Wayback Machine archives web pages since 1996</li>
  <li>Visit <a href="https://web.archive.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.archive.org</a> and enter any URL to see historical versions</li>
  <li>Browse snapshots by date using the calendar interface</li>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/wayback-fixer/">TinyUtils Wayback Fixer</a> to batch-find archived versions of broken links</li>
  <li>Save pages yourself with "Save Page Now" for future reference</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what">What is the Wayback Machine?</h2>
<p>
  The Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web, maintained by the Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. It contains over 800 billion web pages captured since 1996—one of the largest archives of human knowledge ever created.
</p>
<p>
  The system works by crawling the web with automated bots, similar to how search engines index content, but instead of discarding old versions, the Wayback Machine keeps them all. Each capture is a snapshot frozen in time, showing exactly what a page contained at that moment.
</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How the Wayback Machine Works</h2>

<h3>Crawling and Capture</h3>
<p>
  Internet Archive crawlers continuously visit websites, downloading pages and their assets (images, CSS, JavaScript). The frequency depends on various factors—popular sites might be captured multiple times per day, while obscure pages might have captures months apart.
</p>

<h3>Storage and Access</h3>
<p>
  Captured pages are stored with timestamps, creating a historical record. When you request an archived page, you're served the exact HTML, CSS, and assets from that capture. Links within archived pages point to other archived content when available.
</p>

<h3>Archive URLs</h3>
<p>
  Archived pages have URLs in this format:
</p>
<pre><code>https://web.archive.org/web/[TIMESTAMP]/[ORIGINAL_URL]</code></pre>
<p>
  For example:
</p>
<pre><code>https://web.archive.org/web/20100315/https://example.com</code></pre>
<p>
  The timestamp format is YYYYMMDDHHmmss (year, month, day, hour, minute, second). This URL structure lets you link directly to specific snapshots.
</p>

<h2 id="uses">What You Can Do With It</h2>

<h3>Research Website History</h3>
<p>
  See how any website evolved over time. Watch company messaging change, track feature additions, observe design trends. This is invaluable for UX research, competitive analysis, academic research on web history, or pure nostalgia (remember what Amazon looked like in 1999?).
</p>

<h3>Recover Lost Content</h3>
<p>
  Accidentally deleted a page? Previous version of your site destroyed? If the Wayback Machine captured it, you can recover the content. This has saved countless websites, articles, and valuable information from permanent loss.
</p>

<h3>Fix Broken Links</h3>
<p>
  When cited sources go offline, replace broken links with archived versions. Your references remain functional, and readers can still access the content you cited. This preserves the integrity of research, journalism, and any content that relies on external sources.
</p>

<h3>Verify Historical Claims</h3>
<p>
  Check what a website actually said at a specific time. Useful for fact-checking ("Did they really say that on their website?"), legal matters (contractual terms, terms of service at a specific date), and journalistic investigation.
</p>

<h3>Monitor Changes</h3>
<p>
  Compare snapshots to see what changed between captures. Track policy updates, terms of service modifications, pricing changes, or content revisions.
</p>

<h3>Preserve Important Pages</h3>
<p>
  Use "Save Page Now" to archive pages you think might disappear or that you want to reference in the future. Create your own permanent citations.
</p>

<h2 id="how-to">How to Use the Wayback Machine</h2>

<h3>Basic Lookup</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://web.archive.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.archive.org</a></li>
  <li>Enter the URL you want to see in the search box</li>
  <li>Press Enter or click "Browse History"</li>
  <li>You'll see a calendar showing all available snapshots</li>
  <li>Click any date with captures (indicated by dots)</li>
  <li>Select a specific time from that day</li>
  <li>Navigate the archived site normally</li>
</ol>

<h3>Understanding the Calendar</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blue circles:</strong> Snapshots exist for that date</li>
  <li><strong>Circle size:</strong> Larger circles mean more captures that day</li>
  <li><strong>Color intensity:</strong> Indicates capture density</li>
  <li><strong>Click a date:</strong> Shows all captures from that day with timestamps</li>
</ul>

<h3>Direct URL Access</h3>
<p>
  Use the wildcard format to see all captures:
</p>
<pre><code>https://web.archive.org/web/*/example.com</code></pre>
<p>
  Or construct a direct URL to a specific date:
</p>
<pre><code>https://web.archive.org/web/20200115/https://example.com</code></pre>

<h3>Saving Pages Yourself</h3>
<p>
  Use "Save Page Now" at the bottom of the Wayback Machine homepage:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the URL you want to archive</li>
  <li>Click "Save Page"</li>
  <li>The system captures a fresh snapshot</li>
  <li>You get a permanent archived URL to cite</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Pro Tips for Effective Use</h2>

<h3>Try Different URLs</h3>
<p>
  If example.com/page doesn't have captures, try:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>example.com (the homepage)</li>
  <li>example.com/page/ (with trailing slash)</li>
  <li>www.example.com/page (with or without www)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Check Neighboring Dates</h3>
<p>
  If the specific date you want isn't captured, check dates before and after. Content often didn't change between captures.
</p>

<h3>Use the CDX API</h3>
<p>
  For bulk lookups, developers can query the CDX Server API:
</p>
<pre><code>https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=example.com&output=json</code></pre>
<p>
  This returns all captures in a structured format for programmatic processing.
</p>

<h3>Export and Save</h3>
<p>
  For important archived pages, save a local copy. The Wayback Machine is helpful, but it’s not a hard drive you control — captures disappear, assets go missing, and sometimes a snapshot is half a page. If it matters, keep your own backup.
</p>

<h2 id="limitations">What It Can't Do</h2>

<h3>Login-Required Pages</h3>
<p>
  Private content behind authentication isn't captured. The crawlers can't log in, so dashboards, private profiles, and gated content aren't archived.
</p>

<h3>Everything</h3>
<p>
  Not every page is archived. Sites can be too obscure to be crawled, robots.txt can block archiving, or timing can miss ephemeral content.
</p>

<h3>Dynamic Content</h3>
<p>
  JavaScript-heavy sites may not render correctly. Single-page applications, interactive features, and dynamically-loaded content often don't capture properly. You might see loading spinners or broken functionality.
</p>

<h3>Real-Time</h3>
<p>
  There's a delay between when content is published and when it's captured. Breaking news or rapidly-changing content may not be captured in real-time.
</p>

<h3>Removed Content</h3>
<p>
  Site owners can request removal of their content from the archive. Some captures may have been deleted at the owner's request.
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Using TinyUtils for Batch Archive Lookups</h2>
<p>
  Have multiple broken links that need archived versions? Manual lookup is tedious. <a href="/tools/wayback-fixer/">TinyUtils Wayback Fixer</a> automates the process:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter your broken URLs (paste multiple at once)</li>
  <li>The tool queries the Wayback Machine for each URL</li>
  <li>Get archive.org URLs for all available snapshots</li>
  <li>Export results as CSV for easy processing</li>
</ol>
<p>
  This saves significant time when fixing broken links across a website after sources disappear.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How often are pages archived?</h3>
<p>
  It varies widely. Popular sites like major news outlets might be captured multiple times per day. Lesser-known sites might have captures months or years apart. Some sites have thousands of captures; others have none.
</p>

<h3>Can I remove my site from the archive?</h3>
<p>
  Site owners can request removal. The Internet Archive respects robots.txt going forward, and will remove past captures upon valid request. This isn't automatic—you need to contact them.
</p>

<h3>Is using the archive legal?</h3>
<p>
  For research, journalism, personal use, and most legitimate purposes, yes. Republishing archived content at scale may have copyright implications. The archive itself is protected as a library under US law.
</p>

<h3>Why are some images/styles broken?</h3>
<p>
  The archive captures what it can at the time. Resources hosted on different domains may not have been captured, third-party services may have blocked crawling, or some resources may have failed to load during capture.
</p>

<h3>Can I trust that archived content is authentic?</h3>
<p>
  The Wayback Machine captures pages as they were served at the time. However, it captures what it receives—if a site served different content to different users, the archive shows what the crawler received. For legal purposes, additional verification may be needed.
</p>

<h3>How long will the archive exist?</h3>
<p>
  The Internet Archive is committed to permanent preservation. It's a nonprofit with multiple funding sources and mirror locations. However, like any organization, its future isn't guaranteed. For truly critical references, maintain your own backups.
</p>
