<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>How often are pages archived?</h3>
<p>
  Popular sites might be captured multiple times per day.
  Lesser-known sites might have snapshots months apart.
</p>

<h3>Can I remove my site from the archive?</h3>
<p>
  Site owners can request removal, but it's not automatic.
  The archive respects robots.txt going forward but doesn't delete past captures by default.
