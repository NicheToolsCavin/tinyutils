<p>
  PNG files are great for screenshots, logos, and anything with transparency.
  But they can get <em>chunky</em>. A single PNG screenshot can easily hit 2-5 MB,
  which is brutal for page load times and email attachments.
</p>

<p>
  The good news: PNG compression can often cut file sizes by 50-80% without visible quality loss.
  And you can do it right in your browser without uploading to sketchy servers.

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a> for quick, private PNG compression.</li>
  <li>For web use, consider converting to WebP (even smaller files).</li>
  <li>Resize first if your PNG is larger than it needs to be.</li>
  <li>Lossless PNG compression is limited; lossy (via WebP/JPEG) saves more.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why PNG files get so large</h2>
<p>
  PNG uses lossless compression, which means it preserves every pixel exactly.
  That's great for quality, but it limits how much the file can shrink.
  Screenshots, UI mockups, and graphics with large flat color areas compress well.
  Photos? Not so much — that's where JPEG or WebP wins.

<h2 id="how">How to compress PNG online (step-by-step)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop your PNG files (batch is fine).</li>
  <li>Choose output format:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PNG</strong> — keeps transparency, moderate compression</li>
      <li><strong>WebP</strong> — best compression, keeps transparency, modern browsers only</li>
      <li><strong>JPEG</strong> — smallest for photos, but no transparency</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adjust quality slider (80% is a good starting point for WebP/JPEG).</li>
  <li>Optional: set max width/height to resize.</li>
  <li>Download the compressed files.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="lossless-vs-lossy">Lossless vs lossy: what's the difference?</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Lossless</strong> (PNG → PNG): The image looks identical, pixel for pixel.
  Compression is limited to removing metadata and optimizing encoding.
  Expect 10-30% size reduction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Lossy</strong> (PNG → WebP or JPEG): Some pixel data is discarded.
  At 80% quality, most people can't tell the difference.
  Expect 60-90% size reduction.
</p>

<h2 id="transparency">What about transparency?</h2>
<p>
  PNG supports transparency. JPEG doesn't.
  If you need a transparent background, stick with PNG or WebP.
  Converting a transparent PNG to JPEG will give you a white (or black) background.
</p>

<h2 id="resize">The resize trick</h2>
<p>
  A 4000×3000 PNG is massive no matter how you compress it.
  If you're using it on a website at 800px wide, resize to 1600px (2x for retina).
  This often saves more than any compression setting.
</p>

<h2 id="batch">Batch compression</h2>
<p>
  Got 50 screenshots? Don't compress them one by one.
  TinyUtils Image Compressor handles batches — drop them all in, adjust settings once,
  and download a ZIP of the results.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is online PNG compression safe?</h3>
<p>
  It depends on the tool. TinyUtils processes images in your browser — files never leave your device.
  Many other tools upload to servers. Check their privacy policy.
</p>

<h3>Will I lose quality?</h3>
<p>
  With PNG → PNG, no. With PNG → WebP/JPEG at 80%+, quality loss is usually invisible.
</p>

<h3>Can I compress PNGs with transparency?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. PNG and WebP both support transparency. JPEG doesn't.
