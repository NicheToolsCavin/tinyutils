<p>
  Markdown is beloved for its clean syntax—but sometimes you need something even cleaner. Plain text strips away all formatting, leaving pure content that works everywhere: email bodies, terminal displays, legacy systems, text analysis pipelines, and anywhere that expects raw, unformatted text. Converting Markdown to TXT removes the asterisks, hashtags, and brackets, giving you just the words.

<h3>What is Markdown?</h3>
<p>
  Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses simple symbols to indicate formatting: hashtags for headings, asterisks for emphasis, dashes for lists, brackets for links. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown lets writers focus on content while maintaining readable source files. The syntax is designed to be intuitive—a line starting with ## obviously looks like a subheading even before any processing.
</p>
<p>
  Markdown has become the standard for technical documentation, README files, wikis, and note-taking applications. Developers write in Markdown because it integrates perfectly with version control systems like Git. Writers use Markdown because the source files remain readable without special software. But Markdown syntax, while minimal, is still markup—and some contexts require absolutely no markup at all.
</p>

<h3>What is Plain Text?</h3>
<p>
  Plain text (TXT) is the most fundamental digital document format: characters and nothing else. No formatting codes, no markup, no hidden metadata—just the text content itself. Plain text files are universally compatible, opening identically on every computer, operating system, and text editor ever made. From 1960s mainframes to modern smartphones, plain text works everywhere.
</p>
<p>
  The simplicity of plain text makes it ideal for specific use cases: email bodies that need to work in any client, content for legacy systems that can't parse markup, input for text analysis tools that expect raw text, and archival storage where long-term readability matters more than formatting.
</p>

<h2 id="why">Why Convert Markdown to Plain Text?</h2>

<h3>1. Email Composition</h3>
<p>
  Email clients handle plain text predictably. When you paste Markdown syntax into an email, recipients see the asterisks and brackets as literal characters. Converting to plain text first gives you clean content that looks professional in any email client—from corporate Outlook to command-line mail programs.
</p>

<h3>2. Text Analysis and Processing</h3>
<p>
  Natural language processing tools, sentiment analyzers, word frequency counters, and machine learning text classifiers expect plain text input. Markdown syntax can confuse these tools—asterisks might be counted as words, heading markers might skew statistics. Plain text provides the clean input that text analysis requires.
</p>

<h3>3. Legacy System Compatibility</h3>
<p>
  Many enterprise systems—particularly in government, healthcare, and manufacturing—run on older software that can't process any markup language. These systems accept plain text and nothing else. Converting Markdown to TXT enables integration with legacy infrastructure without manual cleanup.
</p>

<h3>4. Terminal and Command-Line Display</h3>
<p>
  When displaying text in terminals or command-line interfaces, you want content without markup characters cluttering the output. Plain text displays cleanly in any terminal environment, from modern terminals with full Unicode support to basic SSH sessions.
</p>

<h3>5. Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  Some screen readers and assistive technologies handle plain text more predictably than marked-up content. For maximum accessibility, plain text removes any potential confusion about how formatting markers should be read or interpreted.
</p>

<h3>6. Content Extraction</h3>
<p>
  When you need to extract just the content from Markdown documents—for quotes, citations, or repurposing—plain text gives you exactly what you need without manual removal of syntax markers.
</p>

<h2 id="what-changes">What Gets Removed in Conversion</h2>
<p>
  Converting Markdown to plain text strips all syntax markers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Heading markers</strong> — # symbols are removed; heading text remains</li>
  <li><strong>Emphasis markers</strong> — ** and * around bold/italic text are stripped</li>
  <li><strong>Link syntax</strong> — [text](url) becomes just "text"</li>
  <li><strong>Image syntax</strong> — ![alt](url) may become just the alt text</li>
  <li><strong>Code fences</strong> — ``` markers removed; code content preserved</li>
  <li><strong>Inline code markers</strong> — Backticks removed; code text kept</li>
  <li><strong>List markers</strong> — - and * at line starts are removed or converted to simple dashes</li>
  <li><strong>Numbered list prefixes</strong> — 1. 2. 3. numbering may be preserved or simplified</li>
  <li><strong>Blockquote markers</strong> — > symbols are stripped</li>
  <li><strong>Horizontal rules</strong> — --- becomes a blank line or is removed</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's Preserved</h3>
<p>
  The conversion keeps what matters:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All text content</strong> — Every word from your Markdown document</li>
  <li><strong>Line breaks</strong> — Paragraph structure is maintained</li>
  <li><strong>Basic structure</strong> — Headings become plain text on their own lines</li>
  <li><strong>Lists as text</strong> — List items remain as separate lines</li>
  <li><strong>Code content</strong> — Code blocks become plain text, without fencing</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>
  The converter strips all Markdown syntax cleanly, producing plain text that's ready for any use case.
</p>

<h3>Batch Conversion</h3>
<p>
  Converting a documentation folder or note collection? Upload multiple Markdown files at once. The converter processes each file and delivers a ZIP archive containing all your plain text files, preserving original filenames with .txt extensions.
</p>

<h2 id="tables">How Tables Convert</h2>
<p>
  Markdown tables use pipes (|) and dashes (-) to create visual structure. When converting to plain text:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cell content is preserved</strong> — Text from each cell remains</li>
  <li><strong>Visual structure is lost</strong> — Pipes and dashes are removed or become plain characters</li>
  <li><strong>Rows become lines</strong> — Each row typically becomes a line of text with cell contents separated by spaces or tabs</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For documents where table data structure matters, consider converting to CSV instead, which preserves tabular structure in a universal format.
</p>

<h2 id="use-cases">Common Use Cases</h2>

<h3>README Content for Emails</h3>
<p>
  Need to include README content in an email or support ticket? Converting to plain text strips the Markdown syntax, giving you clean content that pastes professionally into any email client.
</p>

<h3>Text Analysis and NLP</h3>
<p>
  Running word counts, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or machine learning text classification? Plain text is the cleanest input format. Markdown syntax can confuse tokenizers and skew word frequency calculations.
</p>

<h3>Content Migration</h3>
<p>
  Moving content from Markdown-based systems to platforms that expect plain text? Converting first ensures clean import without manual cleanup of formatting markers.
</p>

<h3>Printing Simple Documents</h3>
<p>
  When you want to print Markdown content as simple text without any formatting—just words on paper—plain text output provides exactly that.
</p>

<h3>Data Entry</h3>
<p>
  Populating database fields, form inputs, or CMS text areas often requires plain text. Converting Markdown first prevents markup characters from appearing where they don't belong.
</p>

<h3>Quotation and Citation</h3>
<p>
  When quoting from Markdown documents, plain text extraction gives you clean content for citations without accidentally including syntax markers.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Will I lose my content?</h3>
<p>
  No content is lost—only formatting markers are removed. All your text remains intact. The conversion is purely subtractive: it removes Markdown syntax without altering the actual words.
</p>

<h3>What about tables?</h3>
<p>
  Table content is preserved; visual structure (pipes and alignment) is removed. The resulting text shows cell contents without the grid layout. For structured data, consider CSV output instead.
</p>

<h3>Is this reversible?</h3>
<p>
  No—once converted to plain text, the formatting information is gone. The converter can't know which text was originally a heading or which words were bold. Always keep your original Markdown file if you might need the formatting later.
</p>

<h3>What about code blocks?</h3>
<p>
  Code content is preserved; the fencing syntax (```) is removed. The code appears as plain text without any special formatting. Indentation within code blocks is typically preserved.
</p>

<h3>Will links be preserved?</h3>
<p>
  Link text (the visible words) is preserved. The URLs are typically removed since plain text has no concept of hyperlinks. If you need URLs preserved, they may appear inline or be stripped depending on the conversion settings.
</p>

<h3>What's the maximum file size?</h3>
<p>
  The converter handles Markdown files up to 50MB, which covers virtually any text-based Markdown document. Very large files with extensive content process in seconds.
</p>
