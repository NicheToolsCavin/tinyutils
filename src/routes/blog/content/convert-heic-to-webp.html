  HEIC is the photo format your iPhone loves and the rest of the internet politely refuses to deal with.
  If you’ve ever uploaded a photo and gotten “unsupported format”, you’ve met the HEIC problem.
</p>

<p>
  The fix is simple: convert HEIC to a web-friendly format like WebP.
  And you can do it without uploading your photos anywhere.

</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why WebP?</h2>
<p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality tips (so it still looks good)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>If it’s a photo:</strong> WebP around <code>0.75–0.85</code> is often the sweet spot.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>If it’s a screenshot/UI:</strong> keep quality higher, or consider PNG/WebP depending on sharp edges.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>If file size is still large:</strong> resizing can have a bigger impact than lowering quality.

</ul>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is HEIC the same as HEIF?</h3>
<p>
  HEIF is the container format family. HEIC is a common file extension for HEIF images.
  In practice, treat them the same for conversion.
</p>

<h3>Should I convert to JPEG instead?</h3>
<p>
  If you need maximum compatibility (older systems, some legacy workflows), JPEG is fine.
  For web delivery, WebP is usually the better choice.
</p>

<h3>Does converting require uploading my photos?</h3>
<p>
  With TinyUtils Image Compressor, processing runs in your browser.
  That means you can convert without sending your photos to a server.

<h2 id="next">Next steps</h2>
<p>
  If you’re converting HEIC because you’re prepping images for a site,
  you’ll usually want to compress at the same time.
  Open <a href="/tools/image-compressor/">TinyUtils Image Compressor</a>, pick WebP, and you’re done.
