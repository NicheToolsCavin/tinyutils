  LaTeX dominates print; HTML dominates the web. For decades, these two worlds existed separately—papers published as PDF, websites built in HTML. But academic content increasingly needs to live online: open access journals, research blogs, educational websites, searchable documentation. Converting LaTeX to HTML brings your beautifully typeset academic work to the web, making it accessible, linkable, and searchable by anyone with a browser.

<h3>What is LaTeX?</h3>
<p>
  LaTeX is the premier typesetting system for academic and scientific documents. Built on Donald Knuth's TeX, LaTeX excels at mathematical notation, complex document structures, and producing consistently beautiful output for print. Academics in mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering rely on LaTeX because nothing else handles equations, references, and large documents with the same precision.
</p>
<p>
  LaTeX operates on a compilation model: you write plain text with markup commands (\section{}, \begin{equation}, \cite{}), then compile to produce typeset output. This separation of content and presentation provides powerful control but creates documents optimized for print rather than screen.
</p>

<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
<p>
  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of the web. Every webpage, from simple blogs to complex applications, is built on HTML. Unlike LaTeX's fixed page layouts, HTML flows and adapts to any screen size—desktop monitors, tablets, phones. Web content is searchable, linkable, and accessible to anyone with a browser.
</p>
<p>
  HTML wasn't designed for mathematical content, which is why academic publishing historically avoided it. But modern web standards have changed this: MathML provides native math markup, MathJax renders LaTeX-style math beautifully in any browser, and CSS offers sophisticated typography. The web is finally ready for academic content.
</p>

<h2 id="why">Why Convert LaTeX to HTML?</h2>

<h3>1. Web Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  HTML is inherently more accessible than PDF. Screen readers parse HTML directly. Text reflows for users who need large fonts. Links work naturally. Converting LaTeX to HTML opens your research to readers using assistive technologies who may struggle with PDFs.
</p>

<h3>2. Mobile-Friendly Reading</h3>
<p>
  PDFs on mobile devices require constant zooming and panning—a frustrating reading experience. HTML flows naturally to fit any screen size. Readers can consume your content comfortably on phones and tablets without fighting the format.
</p>

<h3>3. Search Engine Visibility</h3>
<p>
  Search engines index HTML content directly. If you want your research discoverable through Google Scholar, Bing, or web search, HTML versions improve visibility. PDFs are indexed less effectively, especially their full text content.
</p>

<h3>4. Online Documentation</h3>
<p>
  Technical documentation, textbooks, and course materials work better as navigable HTML. Convert LaTeX textbooks to HTML for online learning platforms, documentation sites, and educational wikis where readers need to search, navigate, and bookmark content.
</p>

<h3>5. Open Access Publishing</h3>
<p>
  Many open access journals publish HTML versions alongside PDF. If you're self-publishing research on your website, an HTML version provides a better reading experience than embedding PDFs.
</p>

<h3>6. Interactive Content</h3>
<p>
  HTML can incorporate interactive elements that PDF can't: embedded videos, interactive diagrams, expandable sections, live code examples. Converting to HTML is the first step toward enriching your content with web interactivity.
</p>

<h2 id="preserved">What Converts from LaTeX to HTML</h2>
<p>
  The conversion translates LaTeX structures to semantic HTML:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Document structure</strong> — \section{}, \subsection{} become h1, h2, h3 headings</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraphs</strong> — Body text becomes p elements with proper HTML structure</li>
  <li><strong>Mathematical notation</strong> — Equations convert to MathML or MathJax-compatible format</li>
  <li><strong>Lists</strong> — itemize and enumerate become ul and ol elements</li>
  <li><strong>Tables</strong> — LaTeX tables convert to HTML tables</li>
  <li><strong>Links</strong> — \href{} and \url{} become clickable anchor tags</li>
  <li><strong>Images</strong> — \includegraphics{} becomes img elements</li>
  <li><strong>Emphasis</strong> — \textbf{} becomes strong, \textit{} becomes em</li>
  <li><strong>Code</strong> — verbatim environments become code elements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mathematical Content</h3>
<p>
  LaTeX's mathematical notation is the primary challenge in HTML conversion. Modern solutions handle this well:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MathML</strong> — Native HTML math markup, supported by all modern browsers</li>
  <li><strong>MathJax notation</strong> — LaTeX math syntax preserved for MathJax rendering</li>
  <li><strong>KaTeX notation</strong> — Alternative renderer, faster than MathJax</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The converted HTML typically preserves your original LaTeX math syntax in a format that MathJax or KaTeX can render in the browser.
</p>

<h2 id="steps">How to Convert LaTeX to HTML</h2>

<h3>Using TinyUtils Document Converter</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <a href="/tools/text-converter/">TinyUtils Document Converter</a></li>
  <li>Click the upload area or drag and drop your .tex file</li>
  <li>Select <strong>HTML</strong> from the output format dropdown</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Convert</strong> to process the document</li>
  <li>Download the HTML file</li>
  <li>Add MathJax script to your page for equation rendering (if needed)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The converter produces clean, semantic HTML suitable for publishing on any website, blog, or documentation platform.
</p>

<h3>Multi-File Projects</h3>
<p>
  For LaTeX projects with multiple files (chapters, images, style files), upload everything as a ZIP file. The converter processes the main .tex file with all dependencies resolved.
</p>

<h3>Batch Conversion</h3>
<p>
  Converting multiple documents? Upload several .tex files at once. The converter processes each independently and delivers all HTML files in a single ZIP download.
</p>

<h2 id="math">Rendering Mathematical Content</h2>
<p>
  The converted HTML preserves mathematical notation in a format renderable by browser-based math engines. To display equations properly, include MathJax or KaTeX on your webpage.
</p>

<h3>Adding MathJax</h3>
<p>
  Include MathJax in your HTML page's head section:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  MathJax automatically finds and renders LaTeX math notation in your converted HTML, producing beautiful equations that look nearly identical to LaTeX PDF output.
</p>

<h3>Adding KaTeX (Faster Alternative)</h3>
<p>
  KaTeX renders faster than MathJax but supports fewer LaTeX features:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.9/dist/katex.min.css"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.9/dist/katex.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.9/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  For documents with many equations, KaTeX's speed advantage is noticeable. Choose based on your equation complexity and performance needs.
</p>

<h2 id="styling">Styling Your HTML</h2>
<p>
  The converted HTML is semantic but unstyled—it uses proper elements (h1, h2, p, table) but relies on you for visual presentation. This is intentional: it lets you apply any CSS design.
</p>

<h3>Basic Styling</h3>
<p>
  At minimum, add some CSS for readability:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Max width</strong> — Limit line length for comfortable reading (60-80 characters)</li>
  <li><strong>Font choice</strong> — Use readable fonts like Georgia, Palatino, or web-optimized fonts</li>
  <li><strong>Spacing</strong> — Add margins between paragraphs and sections</li>
  <li><strong>Responsive layout</strong> — Ensure the content adapts to different screen sizes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Academic Styling</h3>
<p>
  For academic-looking output, consider CSS that mimics traditional typesetting:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Serif fonts</strong> — Match the classic LaTeX look with Times, Palatino, or Computer Modern (available as web fonts)</li>
  <li><strong>Justified text</strong> — Use text-align: justify for a formal appearance</li>
  <li><strong>Proper heading hierarchy</strong> — Size and weight headings appropriately</li>
  <li><strong>Figure captions</strong> — Style figure and table captions consistently</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-cases">Common Use Cases</h2>

  Educators can convert LaTeX lecture notes, problem sets, and course materials to HTML for student-friendly online access. Students can read on any device without downloading files.
</p>

<h3>Documentation Sites</h3>
<p>
  Technical documentation originally written in LaTeX can be converted to HTML for integration into documentation platforms like ReadTheDocs, GitBook, or custom documentation sites.
</p>

<h3>Open Access Journals</h3>
<p>
  Many open access publishers provide both PDF and HTML versions. Converting your LaTeX source to HTML creates the web version that complements your PDF publication.
</p>

<h3>Personal Academic Websites</h3>
<p>
  Present your publications on your personal website in readable HTML format. Visitors can read summaries and papers directly in their browser, improving engagement with your research.
</p>

<h3>Wikipedia and Wiki Contributions</h3>
<p>
  Converting LaTeX explanations to HTML (with appropriate math markup) can help when contributing mathematical content to wikis, educational platforms, or knowledge bases.
</p>

<h2 id="images">Handling Images and Figures</h2>
<p>
  LaTeX \includegraphics{} commands convert to HTML img elements. For the images to display:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Include images in upload</strong> — Upload your .tex file along with all referenced images as a ZIP</li>
  <li><strong>Check paths</strong> — Ensure image paths in the HTML match your file structure</li>
  <li><strong>Web-friendly formats</strong> — JPG, PNG, and SVG work best in browsers; EPS may need conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you're using TikZ or PGF for diagrams, these convert to static images during processing. Complex vector graphics may require manual optimization for web display.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Will my custom LaTeX macros work?</h3>
<p>
  Standard LaTeX macros convert successfully. Very custom macros—especially those defining complex structures—may need to be expanded or simplified before conversion. Simple \newcommand definitions for text shortcuts typically work fine.
</p>

<h3>What about figures and images?</h3>
<p>
  Images referenced with \includegraphics{} convert to img elements. Include all image files in your upload (as a ZIP alongside the .tex file) for them to appear in the output.
</p>

<h3>Is this good for papers or documentation?</h3>
<p>
  Both work well. Academic papers convert to structured HTML suitable for online publication. Technical documentation becomes navigable web content. The semantic HTML structure serves either use case.
</p>

<h3>Will cross-references work?</h3>
<p>
  \label{} and \ref{} convert to HTML anchors and links. Section references, figure references, and equation references become clickable links within the document.
</p>

<h3>What about bibliographies?</h3>
<p>
  Bibliography entries from BibTeX can be converted, though the result depends on your citation style and setup. \cite{} references link to the bibliography section. For complex bibliographies, review the output for proper formatting.
</p>

<h3>Can I convert back to LaTeX?</h3>
<p>
  HTML to LaTeX conversion is possible but less common. For the best workflow, keep your LaTeX source as the master and generate HTML when needed for web publishing.
</p>
