# TinyUtils — What do I click? (Cavin edition)

**Goal:** get a private test link you can click around. No public changes happen until you say so.

1. Go to **vercel.com** → Log in → **Add New… → Project**.
2. Choose **Upload** and select the ZIP in this folder named `tinyutils-v1_3_0_rc3_plus.zip` (or import the GitHub repo if you have one).
3. On the settings screen:
   - Framework: **Other**
   - Build command: **(leave empty)**
   - Output directory: **/** (just a single slash)
4. Click **Deploy**. Copy the link it gives you (looks like `https://tinyutils-xxxx.vercel.app`). That’s your **private preview**.
5. Open that link. Try the three tools. If something breaks, tell me the link and what you clicked.
6. When you’re happy, say “OK, let’s go live” and I’ll give you the exact two things to set in your domain. Done.
