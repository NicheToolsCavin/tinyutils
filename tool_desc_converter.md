## Converter Tool — Description and Change Log

### Major changes — 2025-11-12 CET (UTC+01:00)

Added
• New static UI at `/tools/text-converter/` supporting paste or file upload; formats: .md, .txt, .html, .docx, .rtf (input); targets: md, txt, html, docx, rtf.
• Options UI wired to API for `acceptTrackedChanges`, `extractMedia`, `removeZeroWidth`.
• Preview (MVP) panel that renders headings/snippets/images when `preview` is present in the API response.
• SEO landers: `/docx-to-markdown/`, `/rtf-to-markdown/`, `/html-to-markdown/` redirect to the converter with presets.
• Sitemap entries for the converter and landers.

Modified
• Text Converter UI now maps API fields accurately (`target`→format, `name`→filename, `blobUrl` for download); removed reliance on non-existent `data.ok`.
• Canonical link on converter page is site-relative (`/tools/text-converter/`).

Removed
• None.

Human-readable summary
The Universal Converter is now visible in the UI. Users can paste or upload a document (Word/RTF/HTML/Markdown/Text), pick output formats, and download results. Basic options (accept tracked changes, extract media, remove zero-width) are available. A simple preview panel appears when the backend returns preview metadata. We also added SEO-friendly landers for common conversions and listed them in the sitemap.

Impact
• Users can run docx→md/html/txt and similar flows directly from the tools page; batch ZIP and full normalization presets remain future work.
• Existing API contract is honored (no breaking changes); UI no longer assumes differing field names.
• Landers provide shareable routes for specific conversions; sitemap updated accordingly.

Notes / follow-ups
• Batch ZIP input, media packaging as ZIP, and extended normalization toggles (`normalizeLists`, `normalizeUnicode`, `wrap`, `headers`, `asciiPunctuation`) are planned; UI stubs can be surfaced once backend wiring lands.
• Add Lua filters under `/filters` and wire in `pandoc_runner` for full cleanup parity.
• Consider switching canonical domains at release time to production domain.
