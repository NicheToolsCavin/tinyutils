# Recommendations

## How to use these folders?

- Depending on your model, use the appropriate folder:

  `claude/`

  `chatgpt/`

  `gemini/`

  `qwen/`

  

  Then either make or use the current month folder:

  **example**: `nov` , `dec`, `jan`, `march`, `june`, `jul`

  - Note: Use the short version of any month we're in

  Then make or use a/the folder that is a simple name for the broader task.

  **example**: 

  - `UX_fixes`
  - `new_tool_penis_gallery`
  - `converter fidelity`



Use this as a place to provide recommendations if you are doing a longer project or are in the middle of a task and you believe there's something I should implement, but it's not part of the current task and you can't/don't think you should do it alone or to provide any other recommendations. Though, if something is urgent then it should be mentioned as soon as possible in the chat. And if you leave recs here, then let me know.
