# Test Prompt for Claude Desktop - Dead Link Finder Icon

```
Design a broken chain link icon for a "Dead Link Finder" tool. This is CRITICAL: The icon must have a FULLY TRANSPARENT BACKGROUND with NO container, frame, square, circle, or background element of any kind.

Icon Requirements:
- Concept: Two chain links that are broken/disconnected in the middle
- Style: Clean outline icon (NOT 3D, NOT glossy, NOT filled)
- Stroke: 2-3px consistent stroke weight
- Color: Single color #FF6B9D (pink)
- Line style: Rounded caps and corners for smooth appearance
- Size: Design for 64x64px canvas
- Simplicity: Geometric and minimal - think Material Design or SF Symbols style

What to AVOID:
- ❌ NO rounded square background (this is NOT an app icon)
- ❌ NO glass container or frame
- ❌ NO gradient backgrounds
- ❌ NO shadows or drop effects
- ❌ NO 3D glossy treatment
- ❌ NO dark/light backgrounds of any kind

Background:
- MUST be completely transparent (alpha channel)
- The icon should be just the chain link symbol floating on transparency
- Imagine this will be placed on top of a colored card - nothing should be behind the icon

Style Reference:
- Think: Feather Icons, Heroicons, Lucide - simple outline glyphs
- NOT: iOS app icons, 3D icons, Material filled icons

Output:
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Resolution: @2x (128x128px actual size for 64x64pt display size)
- Color space: sRGB
- Transparency: Full alpha channel support

The final result should look like a simple line drawing of a broken chain that could be overlaid on ANY background color.
