Report Sample Fixture

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This is a short sample report used to exercise the TinyUtils converter
for ODT and DOCX inputs. It includes headings, paragraphs, and a simple
table to mimic a lightweight business report.

SECTION 1 – INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report is to confirm that multi-paragraph content
survives the conversion pipeline without being truncated or rendered
blank.

SECTION 2 – DATA TABLE

| Metric          | Q1   | Q2   |
|-----------------|------|------|
| Revenue (kEUR)  | 120  | 135  |
| New Customers   |  10  |  14  |

SECTION 3 – CONCLUSION

In summary, this report should appear as a non-empty document after
conversion, with the EXECUTIVE SUMMARY heading clearly visible in both
markdown and DOCX outputs.
