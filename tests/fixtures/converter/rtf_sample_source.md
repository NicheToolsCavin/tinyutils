# RTF Sample Document

This document tests RTF format conversion, covering headings, lists, tables, and notes.

## Section 1: Lists

Bulleted list:
- First bullet point
- Second bullet point with **bold** and *italic*
- Third bullet point

Numbered list:
1. First item
2. Second item with [a link](https://example.com)
3. Third item

## Section 2: Table

| Column A | Column B | Column C |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |

## Section 3: Notes

This paragraph contains a footnote reference[^1] to test note preservation in RTF format.

Another paragraph with a second footnote[^2] for validation.

## Conclusion

RTF (Rich Text Format) should preserve basic formatting: **bold**, *italic*, `code`, and structural elements like headings and lists.
