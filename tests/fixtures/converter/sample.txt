TinyUtils Converter - Plain Text Preview Test

This is a plain text file to test the line-numbered preview renderer.

Section 1: Introduction
========================

Plain text files are the simplest format for storing data. They contain only
readable characters without any formatting markup or binary data.

Section 2: Features
===================

Key features of plain text:
- Universal compatibility
- Human-readable
- Easy to version control
- Lightweight and fast
- No proprietary software needed

Section 3: Use Cases
====================

Common use cases include:
1. Configuration files (.conf, .ini, .env)
2. Log files
3. Documentation (README, LICENSE)
4. Source code comments
5. Data interchange (before CSV/JSON became popular)

Section 4: Example Content
===========================

Here's a sample log entry format:

[2025-11-28 21:15:00] INFO: Application started

Plain text remains relevant today for many applications where simplicity
and universality are more important than rich formatting.
