# AdSense placeholders
Replace all occurrences of `ca-pub-REPLACE_ME` with your AdSense publisher ID and set valid `data-ad-slot` values from your AdSense account.
Files touched:
- /index.html
- /tools/keyword-density.html
- /tools/meta-preview.html
- /tools/index.html
- /ads.txt

Notes:
- Keep homepage light; we added one responsive unit under the run controls.
- Tools pages each have one responsive unit near the top.
- After replacing IDs, deploy; ads can take some time to begin serving.
