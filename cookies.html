<h2>Cookie &amp; privacy settings</h2>

<p>TinyUtils keeps things simple: we don't run user accounts and we don't sell your personal data. We do rely on a small amount of technology from Google and our own local storage to keep the site running, understand which tools are useful, and, where enabled, show non-intrusive ads that help keep TinyUtils free.</p>

<h3>What we use</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Analytics</strong> — We may use privacy-friendly analytics to understand which pages are used the most. When analytics are on, we measure visits in aggregate; you can turn them off at any time.</li>
  <li><strong>Ads (Google AdSense)</strong> — On some pages we show Google Ads. Google may use cookies or local storage to show and measure ads. TinyUtils does not get access to your raw ad profiles.</li>
  <li><strong>Local storage</strong> — We store a small consent flag (<code>tu-consent</code>) and a preference for hiding certain ad-related UI (<code>tu-ads-hidden</code>) in your browser so we can remember your choices.</li>
</ul>

<p>For details about how Google uses information from sites like ours, see <a href='https://business.safety.google/privacy/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Google's Privacy &amp; Terms for partners</a>.</p>

<h3>Change your ad &amp; cookie choices</h3>
<p>If you are in the EU/UK/EEA, you may have seen a small banner asking you about analytics and ads the first time you visited TinyUtils. That banner reflects your current choice. You can change it at any time:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the button below to re-open the TinyUtils privacy banner if it is available in your region.</li>
  <li>Or use your browser's privacy or cookie settings to clear site data and start over, if you prefer.</li>
</ol>

<p><button id='tu-reopen-consent' type='button'>Review TinyUtils analytics &amp; ads choices</button></p>
<p id='tu-reopen-consent-status' class='muted'></p>

<h3>Using an ad blocker?</h3>
<p>Ads help cover the cost of bandwidth and development time so TinyUtils can stay free for everyone. If you use an ad blocker, that's okay — the tools will still work — but you can support TinyUtils by allowing ads on this site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open your ad blocker's settings while on <code>tinyutils.net</code> or <code>www.tinyutils.net</code>.</li>
  <li>Look for an option like “allowlist site”, “trusted site”, or “enable on this site” and apply it to TinyUtils.</li>
  <li>Keep in mind we aim for non-intrusive, text-oriented ads and we never gate core features behind ads.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer not to see ads, you can also use any local “hide ads” toggle (when present) in the TinyUtils UI; it only affects how we render ad slots on this device.</p>
