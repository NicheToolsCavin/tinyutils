<h2>Cookie &amp; privacy settings</h2>

<p>TinyUtils keeps things simple: we don't run user accounts and we don't sell your personal data. We do rely on a small amount of technology from Google and our own local storage to keep the site running, understand which tools are useful, and, where enabled, show non-intrusive ads that help keep TinyUtils free.</p>

<h3>What we use</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Analytics</strong> — We may use privacy-friendly analytics to understand which pages are used the most. When analytics are on, we measure visits in aggregate; you can turn them off at any time.</li>
  <li><strong>Ads (Google AdSense)</strong> — On some pages we show Google Ads. Google may use cookies or local storage to show and measure ads. TinyUtils does not get access to your raw ad profiles; consent for ads and measurement is handled by Google's own consent tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Local storage</strong> — We store a small preference for hiding certain ad-related UI (<code>tu-ads-hidden</code>) in your browser so we can remember if you chose to hide ad slots. This does not change how Google serves ads, only how much ad UI we render.</li>
</ul>

<p>For details about how Google uses information from sites like ours, see <a href='https://business.safety.google/privacy/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Google's Privacy &amp; Terms for partners</a>.</p>

<h3>Change your ad &amp; cookie choices</h3>
<p>If you are in a region where Google requires it (for example, the EU/EEA or UK), you may see a Google-branded box with three options the first time you visit TinyUtils. That box is provided by Google Funding Choices and reflects your current consent choices for ads and measurement.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the button below to ask Google to show that consent box again on this device, when it applies.</li>
  <li>Or use your browser's privacy or cookie settings to clear site data and start over, if you prefer.</li>
</ol>

<p><button id='tu-reopen-consent' type='button'>Review Google analytics &amp; ads choices</button></p>
<p id='tu-reopen-consent-status' class='muted'></p>

<h3>Using an ad blocker?</h3>
<p>Ads help cover the cost of bandwidth and development time so TinyUtils can stay free for everyone. If you use an ad blocker, that's okay — the tools will still work — but you can support TinyUtils by allowing ads on this site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open your ad blocker's settings while on <code>tinyutils.net</code> or <code>www.tinyutils.net</code>.</li>
  <li>Look for an option like “allowlist site”, “trusted site”, or “enable on this site” and apply it to TinyUtils.</li>
  <li>Keep in mind we aim for non-intrusive, text-oriented ads and we never gate core features behind ads.</li>
</ul>
