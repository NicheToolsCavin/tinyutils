<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>No login, no cookies by us. Minimal logs for debugging. Ads (AdSense) may appear on some pages if you configure AdSense; they are third‑party and have their own policies. URLs are processed to check status. Minimal logs may include submitted URLs and IPs for debugging and abuse prevention; logs are routinely purged.</p>
<p>We use Plausible (privacy-friendly analytics). You can toggle analytics off on the homepage; your choice is stored locally.</p>
<p>In the EU/UK, if you decline tracking, we may still show non‑personalized ads (no cookies/IDs) to keep the site free. You can change your choice anytime via your browser storage.</p></div></div></body></html>
