# Agent Task Checklist

Shared tracker so agents can see which work items are planned, in progress, or finished - and how plans have evolved.

## How to Use
- **Append-only:** Add new tasks to the top of the relevant table (newest first).
- **Always timestamp:** Record Europe/Madrid (CET) timestamps for new entries and status changes.
- **Reference the source:** Link each task to the session ID / plan entry that created it (e.g., `rollout-2025-11-04T16-26-36-...`).
- **Update status promptly:** When a task is completed, move it to the Completed section with evidence pointers. If a task becomes obsolete, mark it as "Superseded" with the reason.
- **Plan changes:** Log scope or approach changes under Plan Updates and cross-reference the affected task.
- **Helper script:** Use `python scripts/add_task_checklist_entry.py --help` to insert rows and plan updates quickly.

## Active Tasks (Newest First)

| Task | Source (Session / Date) | Status | Notes / Evidence / Plan Changes |
| Wire TinyUtils global AdSense slot into manual .ad-slot placements | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Pointed all live .ad-slot placements (home, tools hub, DLF, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, Text Converter, keyword-density, meta-preview, public index) at data-ad-client=ca-pub-3079281180008443 and data-ad-slot=3664281983 while leaving ADSENSE_SETUP.md examples and *-old.html snapshots as docs. Evidence: artifacts/ads-config/20251118/. |
| PR #48 follow-ups — converter race guard + theme-aware progress | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Addressed remaining PR #48 review items around converter race handling and light-mode progress visibility by gating UI updates on requestCounter and adding a theme-aware --progress-bg token. Commits: not yet created (local changes in styles/site.css and tools/text-converter/index.html). Evidence: artifacts/converter-race-guard/20251118/. |
| Phase 2 UX Transformation - All pages + AdSense complete | manual-2025-11-18 Evening CET | Completed | ✅ Transformed all 6 major pages with stunning design (homepage, tools hub, Dead Link Finder, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, Document Converter). Implemented triple-threat card accent system, 4rem emoji icons, gradient titles, staggered animations. Complete AdSense setup (ads.txt + meta tags + scripts on all pages). Hid Contact page from navigation. Updated sitemap to production domain (tinyutils.net). Commits: f1639ff, c452ab5, 626604a, 9557d05, 8f3c949. Evidence: All smoke tests passing, zero breaking changes. |
| Phase2 PR notes + consolidation | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Verified that Phase 2 track states in docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md match the corresponding entries in docs/AGENT_TASK_CHECKLIST.md (Tracks 1–5 and Workstream A), and added docs/PHASE2_PR_NOTES.md as a concise, PR-ready summary of progress UX, Blob downloads + MD→RTF, ads/CMP, light-mode tokens, and smokes/docs, plus remaining preview/QA steps. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md, docs/AGENT_TASK_CHECKLIST.md, docs/PHASE2_PR_NOTES.md. |
| Phase2 local visual QA – dark/light themes | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Local static server confirms that /, /tools/, and the four core tools serve correctly after Phase 2 changes. No obvious layout/contrast issues were identified from code/CSS review for .ad-slot placement, progress banners, or light-mode tokens; remaining work is a quick real-browser dark/light theme check on a preview to validate these visually. Evidence: styles/site.css, index.html, tools/*.html. |
| Phase2 Workstream A – Preview smokes | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Verified that preview_smoke.mjs and smoke_convert_preview.mjs are wired for PREVIEW_URL + bypass tokens and no-op safely when PREVIEW_URL is missing (preview_smoke reports the missing env; converter smoke logs 'skipping'). Remaining: rerun both smokes once PREVIEW_URL is configured for this branch's Vercel preview and confirm the new ad/progress markers and MD→RTF artifacts behave as expected. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md, scripts/preview_smoke.mjs, scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs. |
| Phase2 Track 5 – Smokes + docs | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Preview smokes now lightly cover Phase 2 surfaces: scripts/preview_smoke.mjs asserts that key pages return 200 and still contain invariant markers (.ad-slot and .progress-banner where expected), and scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs includes an MD→RTF case that writes .rtf artifacts when PREVIEW_URL is set. Remaining: run these smokes against a live preview, adjust expectations if needed, and then mark Track 5 as complete. Evidence: scripts/preview_smoke.mjs, scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs, docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md. |
| Phase2 Track 4 – Light mode tokens | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Light theme tokens in styles/site.css retuned (soft gray background, white panels, darker muted text, clearer borders) so html[data-theme=light] better matches the existing dark-mode visual language while maintaining contrast on cards, tool shells, .ad-slot, and progress banners. Remaining: run preview/visual QA and decide whether a dark-only fallback is needed if light mode still feels off. Evidence: styles/site.css, docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md. |
| Phase2 Track 3 – Ads + CMP (ad slots) | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Phase 2 .ad-slot placements documented and wired: one theme-aware slot on index.html, tools/index.html, and the four core tools; .ad-slot styling in styles/site.css respects html[data-theme] tokens and hides when html.ads-hidden is set. ADSENSE_SETUP.md now describes placement, CMP interaction (Funding Choices + adsense-monitor.js), and what future smokes/manual QA should verify (CMP flow, hide-ads toggle, CLS, themes). Evidence: ADSENSE_SETUP.md, docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md, styles/site.css. |
| Phase2 Track 3 – Ads + CMP (ad slots) | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Inserted one .ad-slot (AdSense unit) on index.html, tools/index.html, and the four core tools (DLF, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, Converter), styled with tokens and hidden when html.ads-hidden is set. Remaining: preview/UX validation, per-tool docs updates, and any fine-tuning of placement/CLS after smokes. |
| Phase2 Track 2 – Downloads + MD→RTF | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Converter downloads now normalize any data: URLs through a Blob-based flow via handleDataUrlDownload + window.tuDownloadBlob, and scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs includes an md_rtf case that will write .rtf artifacts under artifacts/converter-rtf-fix/<YYYYMMDD>/ once PREVIEW_URL is set. Evidence: tools/text-converter/index.html, scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs, docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md. |
| Phase2 nightly status checkpoint (docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md) | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md to reflect Track 1 completion and partial Track 2 state on feat/phase2-ads-light. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md. Follow-up: continue Track 2 downloads + MD→RTF smoke, then ads/light-mode/smokes. |
| Phase2 Track 1 – Progress UX | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Unified progress/working banners and aria-live status areas across DLF, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, and Converter, and guarded global shortcuts with per-tool isBusy flags. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md |
| Phase2 Auto status checkpoint | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Added docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md as an internal Phase 2 Auto status file capturing current tracks, snapshot, and planned steps. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md |
| Refine logging policy to avoid overuse | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | AGENTS.md updated: see AGENTS.md:46, :158, :274. Evidence: artifacts/policy/20251118/AGENTS_md_change.txt |
| Merge PR6: Converter RTF output correctness | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ PR #43 merged into main (4e0ae04); converter now calls pandoc with --standalone for RTF so MD→RTF exports open as full documents in TextEdit/Word. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/pr6-merge/20251118/summary.txt |
| Phase 2 PR6 – Converter RTF output correctness | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Added pandoc --standalone for RTF in api/convert/convert_service.py so MD→RTF emits a single \rtf1 document; validated via pypandoc.convert_text header check. Evidence: artifacts/converter-rtf-fix/20251116/. |
| PR5 preview smokes | manual-2025-11-16 06:52 CET | Completed | ✅ Preview + converter smokes pass. Commits: 3914a5f. Evidence: artifacts/pr5-final-smokes/20251116/preview_smoke.log |
| PR4 tool progress + Try example | manual-2025-11-16 06:45 CET | Completed | ✅ Added Try example flows + progress indicators for DLF/Sitemap/Wayback/Converter. Commits: a2ace21. Evidence: artifacts/pr4-tool-ux/20251116/manual-notes.txt |
| Merge PR45 Phase 3 per-tool preferences | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Rebased & reconciled phase3/pr12-tool-preferences with main so that only TinyUtilsStorage + per-tool prefs wiring and docs remain as deltas, confirmed preview_smoke.mjs PASS on the PR45 preview with automation bypass, and merged PR45 into main at 0b03ede so per-tool prefs are live alongside the theme toggle and DLF CSV work. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/convert/20251116/. |
| Confirm PR44 theme toggle merged and healthy | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Verified that PR44 (Phase 3 PR11: theme toggle) is already merged into main at commit 3da95da, that preview_smoke.mjs passes against the theme-toggle preview with automation bypass, and that the global theme toggle button + scripts/theme-toggle.js are present on / and all tool shells without breaking existing flows. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/phase3-pr11-theme-toggle/20251116/. |
| Merge PR47 Phase 3 DLF CSV refactor | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Reconciled phase3/pr15-dlf-csv-refactor with main, updated smoke_dlf_preview.mjs to honor Vercel automation-bypass envs, ran preview_smoke.mjs and smoke_dlf_preview.mjs against the PR47 preview (all pages/APIs 200 JSON; DLF /api/check ok), and merged PR47 into main. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/dlf-csv/20251118/preview_smoke_dlf.log. |
| PR conflict status check for 26/28/29/47 | manual-2025-11-17 CET | Completed | ✅ Confirmed PR26 and PR29 are closed, PR28 is merged into main, and PR47 (phase3/pr15-dlf-csv-refactor) is up-to-date with main and reported MERGEABLE without reintroducing non-header vercel.json sections or regressing converter behavior. No code changes in this run. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/pr-conflict-check/20251117/status.txt |
| Phase 3 PR11 - global theme toggle | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Implemented light/dark theme toggle via CSS tokens and header control on home/tools/tool pages; client-side only, no /api or CMP/ads changes. Preview smokes: preview_smoke.mjs + smoke_convert_preview.mjs both hit protected preview (401), as expected. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/phase3-pr11-theme-toggle/20251116/. PR: #44 (phase3/pr11-theme-toggle). |
| PR1 - Converter UI PR B + smokes | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Converter UI PR B implemented (primary target + advanced multi-export, expanded Markdown dialects) and converter preview smokes updated to cover mdDialect + multi-export. Evidence: artifacts/convert-pr1-ui/20251116/. |
| TinyUtils Phase1 /plan (converter PR B + UX Phase 1) | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Consolidated high-level PR B + UX Phase 1 docs into an executable /auto plan with agent allocation. Evidence: artifacts/plan/20251116/. |
| Load CGPT context dump (2025-11-16) | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Ingested CGPT_TU_CONTEXTDUMP_20251116T034004.md; updated working mental model for CMP, consent.js, adsense-monitor.js, UX phases, and automation/smokes. Evidence: artifacts/agent-context/20251116/. |
| CMP script on cookies page | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Added the standard Google AdSense tag to cookies.html so Funding Choices / CMP code is loaded on the Cookie & privacy settings page as well, making the 'Review Google analytics & ads choices' button able to call googlefc.showRevocationMessage() when the CMP is active. Evidence: artifacts/pr-c-consent/20251116/. |
| Adblock toast false-positive fix | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated scripts/adsense-monitor.js to consider any truthy window.adsbygoogle as a successful AdSense init, so the 'Ads seem blocked' toast only appears when AdSense never initialized at all. This avoids warning users when ads are actually visible. Evidence: artifacts/pr-c-consent/20251116/. |
| Google CMP reopen + cookies page wiring | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Aligned TinyUtils with Google Funding Choices: scripts/consent.js no longer exposes tuConsent.reopen or runs custom EU heuristics; cookies.html now wires its 'Review' button to googlefc.showRevocationMessage via googlefc.callbackQueue, and scripts/adsense-monitor.js no longer reads tu-consent. Preview/prod smokes queued with evidence under artifacts/pr-c-consent/20251116/. |
| Switch to Google Funding Choices CMP | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Removed the custom EU language/timezone consent banner and wired the official Google Funding Choices CMP script (pub-3079281180008443) into index.html and the key tool shells (tools/, DLF, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, Converter). scripts/consent.js now only handles the local tu-ads-hidden toggle and tuConsent.reopen() calls googlefc.showDialog() when available, so /cookies.html can reopen the Google three-option banner. Preview smokes and converter smokes against the PR preview are green; main will pick this up after the next deploy. |
| Converter formats card + ad toast copy | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Moved the long Supported formats box on /tools/text-converter/ into a collapsible card below the main converter UI, and softened the anti-adblock toast copy so it clearly says ads help with hosting/dev costs while the tools still work if ads remain blocked. No converter API changes; behavior logged in tool_desc_converter.md. Evidence: artifacts/converter-ux-tweaks/20251115/. |
| PR #34 – post-merge production smokes | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Ran scripts/preview_smoke.mjs and scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs against production (https://www.tinyutils.net) after merging PR #34. Result: Preview smoke PASS for /, /tools/*, /cookies.html and all 4 APIs; converter smoke PASS with artifacts in artifacts/pr-b-prod-smoke/20251115/ and artifacts/convert/20251115/. This confirms PR B’s cookie/privacy surface and Converter UI refinements are live and healthy in prod. |
| PR #34 – cookies.html 404 fix + final green smokes | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Fixed /cookies.html 404 on PR #34 preview by committing cookies.html to the PR branch (it was previously untracked locally, so not deployed). vercel.json remains headers-only. Re-ran scripts/preview_smoke.mjs and scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs against the refreshed PR preview (https://tinyutils-git-fix-pr-b-cookie-c-9dd0a8-cavins-projects-7b0e00bb.vercel.app); result: Preview smoke PASS for /, /tools/*, /cookies.html and all four APIs, and converter smoke PASS with existing artifacts under artifacts/pr-b-vercel-fix/20251115/ and artifacts/convert/20251115/. |
| PR #34 – Vercel pdfminer fix + preview smokes | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Fixed PR #34 preview build by dropping the explicit pdfminer.six constraint so pdfplumber can install its compatible version; converter deps now install and layout-aware APIs import cleanly. Preview_smoke against PR preview is still FAIL due only to /cookies.html 404, while /, /tools/* and all 4 APIs return 200/JSON. Converter smoke (smoke_convert_preview.mjs) PASS with artifacts in artifacts/pr-b-vercel-fix/20251115/ and artifacts/convert/20251115/. |
| Converter PR B Phase 2 — UI refinements | manual-2025-11-15 19:11 CET | Completed | ✅ Implemented single-target default + advanced multi-export in tools/text-converter/index.html, aligned Markdown dialect selector with backend allowlist, and added PDF-specific progress summaries based on pdf_* logs while keeping the /api/convert payload contract unchanged. Evidence: artifacts/converter-prb-ui/20251115/. |
| PR B Phase 1 — Cookie & privacy settings page | manual-2025-11-15 19:06 CET | Completed | ✅ Added cookies.html with policy-compliant copy, wired header/footer links across shells, exposed tuConsent.reopen in consent.js, extended preview_smoke to /cookies.html, and updated privacy + TEST_PLAN_SITE. Preview/prod will serve the page after the next deploy; current smoke shows 404 for /cookies.html only. |
| Prod deploy + smoke for www.tinyutils.net | manual-2025-11-15 18:43 CET | Completed | ✅ Merged PR #33 to main, then ran scripts/preview_smoke.mjs against https://www.tinyutils.net with automation bypass; all pages and APIs 200/JSON with request-id. Evidence: artifacts/prod-smoke/20251115/. |
| Fix heading thresholds type annotation | manual-2025-11-15 18:37 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated HEADING_SIZE_THRESHOLDS to Tuple[Tuple[float,int], ...] and confirmed converter modules compile; no behavior change. Evidence shares preview-smoke artifacts for context. |
| Address review fixes + smokes | manual-2025-11-15 18:29 CET | Completed | ✅ Added pdfplumber requirement, cleaned heading heuristics, scrubbed smoke_pdf_new.sh, regenerated Context-from-Repo.md, and reran preview+converter smokes. Commits: pending. Evidence: artifacts/preview-smoke/20251115/review-feedback/, artifacts/convert/20251115/preview-smoke-20251115062851/ |
| Refresh agent context & rules digest | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Re-read AGENTS.md, CHATGPT*, SECURITY, run log, checklist, converter spec, and PDF→MD refactor plan; summarized key rules for this session. Evidence: artifacts/agent-context/20251115/. |
| Headless preview fallback | manual-2025-11-15 19:10 CET | Completed | ✅ Ran scripts/headless_preview_fallback.mjs to snapshot /, /tools/, /tools/text-converter/ when preview is gated; summary+HTML lives in artifacts/agent-mode/20251115/headless-preview/. |
| Plan checkpoint update | manual-2025-11-15 18:55 CET | Completed | ✅ Added PR A completed checkpoint to pdf-md-refactor-plan-2025-11-14.md with artifact links and future candidates. Evidence: ../pdf-md-refactor-plan-2025-11-14.md |
| Converter automated tests | manual-2025-11-15 18:45 CET | Completed | ✅ npm test (node --test) completes covering convert/check/metafetch/WBF; log available in artifacts/tests/20251115/npm-test.log. |
| Agent-assisted runbook | manual-2025-11-15 18:20 CET | Completed | ✅ Added runbook section for Agent Mode, Deep Research, Pro Reasoning + artifact logging instructions. Evidence: docs/AGENT_ASSISTED_PROMPTS.md |
| PDF fixture validation | manual-2025-11-15 18:00 CET | Completed | ✅ Ran convert_one on table-heavy and bookdown PDFs; verified outputs, media zip, and logs/meta for pdf_engine, layout mode, tables/images counts. Evidence: artifacts/convert/test-fixtures |
| QA audit follow-ups (size limits, downloads, progress guidance) | manual-2025-11-15 17:15 CET | Completed | ✅ Verified size limit messaging, HTTP downloads, and progress indicators for converter. Evidence: artifacts/convert/20251115/qa-followup/ |
| QA audit follow-ups (size limits, downloads, progress guidance) | manual-2025-11-15 16:25 CET | Open | 🔎 Add explicit size-limit messaging, enforce HTTP downloads for converter outputs, and capture progress/tooltip feedback per the Nov 15 audit. Evidence: docs/TEST_PLAN_SITE.md, docs/UX_REDESIGN_PLAN.md, docs/AGENT_ASSISTED_PROMPTS.md |
| Clarify AGENTS constraints | manual-2025-11-15 15:45 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated AGENTS.md: vercel header rule now owner-approved for relaxations, removed rigid dependency restriction, added PR comment review cadence. Evidence: AGENTS.md |
| Create Supported Formats page + link + ODT output | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ New page at /tools/formats/; tools index link; converter adds ODT output; sitemap updated. Evidence: tools/formats/index.html |
| Expose ODT output + Supported formats section + preview bypass callout | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Added ODT target; UI lists ODT; new Supported formats section; AGENTS.md loud preview bypass note. Evidence: converter service + UI file. |

## Plan Updates
- 2025-11-18 04:05 CET - Logging policy clarified: log only when material changes occur; skip read-only exploration.
- 2025-11-14 21:09 CET - Set workspace to write; benched teams-personal/teacher; reassigned agents; applied minimal diffs.
- 2025-11-04 13:47 CET - Preview fence commit omitted deployment evidence; tracked under "Preview fence evidence + smoke".
- 2025-11-04 13:34 CET - PR1 commit landed without CSP and `/public` cache rule; captured as follow-up in active tasks.
- 2025-11-04 08:42 CET - Compliance audit flagged keyboard shortcut conflicts; marked "Needs Review" pending verification.
