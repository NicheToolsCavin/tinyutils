# Agent Task Checklist

Shared tracker so agents can see which work items are planned, in progress, or finished - and how plans have evolved.

## How to Use
- **Append-only:** Add new tasks to the top of the relevant table (newest first).
- **Always timestamp:** Record Europe/Madrid (CET) timestamps for new entries and status changes.
- **Reference the source:** Link each task to the session ID / plan entry that created it (e.g., `rollout-2025-11-04T16-26-36-...`).
- **Update status promptly:** When a task is completed, move it to the Completed section with evidence pointers. If a task becomes obsolete, mark it as "Superseded" with the reason.
- **Plan changes:** Log scope or approach changes under Plan Updates and cross-reference the affected task.
- **Helper script:** Use `python scripts/add_task_checklist_entry.py --help` to insert rows and plan updates quickly.

## Active Tasks (Newest First)

| Task | Source (Session / Date) | Status | Notes / Evidence / Plan Changes |
| Expand direct DOCX/ODT routing for rich sources | manual-2025-12-01 CET | Completed | ✅ Direct-from-source docx/odt for odt/docx/rtf/epub/html; HTML→DOCX test added; Evidence: artifacts/odt-docx-regression/20251201/nov16-30_direct_fix.txt |
| Fix ODT→DOCX blank output regression | manual-2025-12-01 CET | Completed | ✅ Direct odt/docx→docx path preserves content (docx_strategy=direct_from_source); tests/test_convert_backend_odt_docx.py pass; Evidence: artifacts/odt-docx-regression/20251201/nov16-30_direct_fix.txt |
| PDF Text Extractor accepts single PDF and ZIP | manual-2025-12-01 07:45 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated Bulk PDF Text Extractor so the UI clearly accepts single PDFs and ZIPs (Svelte input accept=.pdf,.zip,application/pdf,application/zip with copy listing accepted types/50MB cap) and extended api/pdf_extract.py to handle both ZIP-of-PDFs and single-PDF uploads while always returning a ZIP of .txt files. Wired a single-PDF preview test in tests/data_tools_preview.test.mjs plus additional smokes in scripts/smoke_data_tools_preview.mjs (single-PDF path and UI accept check). On the current preview tinyutils-efuyt344x-cavins-projects-7b0e00bb.vercel.app, ZIP-mode checks pass; single-PDF path still returns 422 until the new backend is deployed. Evidence: artifacts/convert/20251201/safari-pdf-preview-bypass/ and future data-tools preview artifacts. |
| Safari PDF accept tiny-reactive smoke bypass & envelope bug fix | manual-2025-12-01 07:20 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated scripts/ui_smoke_safari_pdf_accept.mjs to (1) preflight the preview root with x-vercel-protection-bypass/x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie + trimmed PREVIEW_SECRET, (2) set vercel-protection-bypass + _vercel_jwt cookies via Tiny-Reactive setCookies, and (3) read Tiny-Reactive evaluate envelopes from data.value so #fileInput accept and outerHTML are captured correctly. Re-ran the smoke against preview tinyutils-efuyt344x-cavins-projects-7b0e00bb.vercel.app: hasDotPdf/hasMimePdf are true and the run passes. Evidence: artifacts/convert/20251201/safari-pdf-preview-bypass/. |
| Teach Safari PDF accept tiny-reactive smoke the preview bypass handshake | manual-2025-12-01 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated scripts/ui_smoke_safari_pdf_accept.mjs to preflight preview URLs with x-vercel-protection-bypass/x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie, capture _vercel_jwt, and inject it via Tiny-Reactive setCookies so the smoke can reach /tools/text-converter/ on protected previews. Re-ran the smoke against the current Vercel preview: navigation now succeeds but the accept attribute still lacks .pdf/application/pdf on that deployment, so the smoke correctly reports status=fail. Evidence: artifacts/convert/20251201/safari-pdf-preview-bypass/. |
| Clarify PDF layout controls scope (fallback-only) in converter UI/docs | manual-2025-12-01 CET | Completed | ✅ Added a short note next to the PDF layout controls in the Svelte converter UI explaining they only affect the fallback PDF renderer, and updated tool_desc_converter.md to mirror that these presets apply to the ReportLab path while the external Chromium-based renderer remains unchanged. Evidence: artifacts/convert/20251201/pdf-layout-ux-note/. |
| Expose PDF layout presets (margins/page size) in converter UI + API | manual-2025-12-01 CET | Completed | ✅ Added pdf_margin_preset/pdf_page_size to ConversionOptions and convert_backend.app.Options, wired them into the ReportLab fallback so PDF page size and margin presets can be controlled, and exposed matching controls in the Svelte converter UI (PDF layout + page size) that only affect the fallback renderer. Verified /api/convert health probe and all converter_api_smoke smokes still pass against the latest Vercel preview. Evidence: artifacts/convert/20251201/pdf-layout-presets-ui/. |
| Fix converter html_input logs bug + preview /api/convert handshake | manual-2025-12-01 CET | Completed | ✅ Initialised logs early in convert_backend.convert_service.convert_one to fix UnboundLocalError on html_input.html, updated scripts/convert_health_probe.mjs and tests/converter_api_smoke.mjs to handle Vercel 30x + _vercel_jwt handshake, and verified /api/convert health probe + all converter_api_smoke smokes (tech_doc, html_input.html, odt_invoice_sample.odt) pass against the latest preview. Evidence: artifacts/convert/20251201/html-input-handshake/. |
| Add ODT fixture, convert_backend tests, and ODT→DOCX regression telemetry | manual-2025-12-01 CET | Completed | ✅ Added odt_invoice_sample.odt fixture and Python tests exercising convert_backend odt→docx/md non-blank output with INVOICE markers; instrumented convert_backend stage sizes and suspected_blank_output log tag. Evidence: artifacts/odt-docx-regression/20251201/stage_probe_local_dev.txt |
| Update MCP docs to include openmemory usage | manual-2025-11-30 CET | Completed | ✅ Added openmemory (memory MCP) guidance to AGENTS.md and CHATGPT.md so agents persist/reuse TinyUtils rules/preferences; logged run and created artifacts/mcp-openmemory-usage/20251130. |
| Converter preview time budgets, sanitisation, and UI smokes | manual-2025-11-30 CET | Completed | ✅ Added CSV preview time budgets + fail-soft banner, hardened HTML preview sanitiser (data:/private-host URLs), wired backend format-mismatch telemetry, and created new Puppeteer UI smokes for fail-soft/Markdown responsiveness/Safari PDF accept. Evidence: artifacts/converter-preview-timebudget/20251130/. |
| Converter preview fail-soft, sanitization, meta flags, Safari PDF accept | manual-2025-11-30 CET | Completed | ✅ Added backend HTML preview sanitisation + hasMoreRows/hasMoreNodes meta, wired frontend fail-soft preview banner + Safari PDF accept fix, and refreshed tests/docs. Evidence: artifacts/converter-preview-failsoft/20251130/. |
| Add Vercel Speed Insights to SvelteKit layout | manual-2025-11-30 | Completed | ✅ Installed @vercel/speed-insights with pnpm to avoid npm/pnpm conflicts and imported injectSpeedInsights in src/routes/+layout.svelte. Evidence: artifacts/speed-insights/20251130/. |
| tiny-reactive E2E slice – PDF extractor & Sitemap Generator Tier0 | auto-2025-11-30T-pdf-sitemap-tier0 | Completed | Added Tier0 tiny-reactive UI flows for Bulk PDF Text Extractor and Sitemap Generator, with minimal data-testids, registry selectors, run-all integration, and AGENT_RUN_LOG entry. Current flows assert UI presence only (no file upload or XML download). |
| tiny-reactive E2E slice – CSV Joiner & JSON↔CSV Tier0 | auto-2025-11-30T-csv-json-tier0 | Completed | Added Tier0 tiny-reactive UI flows for CSV Joiner and JSON↔CSV tools, including minimal data-testids, harness registry selectors, run-all wiring, and AGENT_RUN_LOG entry. Flows currently only assert UI presence (upload/convert controls) due to lack of file-upload support in tiny-reactive. |
| tiny-reactive E2E slice 1 – converter convert + DLF list-mode | auto-2025-11-30T-first-slice | Completed | Converter: added Try example → Convert tiny-reactive flow and wired into run-all; DLF: extended harness with list-mode + Export CSV sanity; aggregator now requires both flows for each tool. |
| Tiny-reactive E2E harness scaffold (converter) | manual-2025-11-29 CET | Completed | ✅ Added tests/e2e/tiny-reactive-harness.mjs as a minimal converter UI flow via tiny-reactive; next steps are to generalize registry/config and add other tools. |
| Align Document Converter card height with other tool cards | manual-2025-11-29 CET | Completed | ✅ Added shared min-height to ToolCard with mobile override to even out card sizes on /tools/. Branch: fix/tool-card-height. |
| Fix preview smoke workflow path | manual-2025-11-29 CET | Completed | ✅ Removed workflow working-directory override to fix preview smoke path error. Commit: 9b93f6e. Merged via PR #55 to main. |
| Address Claude PR #54 converter preview review comments | manual-2025-11-29 00:05 CET | Completed | ✅ Hardened converter preview: quote-aware CSV table parsing, JSON pretty-print guard for large payloads, SRI on Prism CDN assets, clearer Markdown 'Plain Text View' label, and documented safe_parse_limited recursion limit. Tests: pnpm test; PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_converter_enhancements.py -q. Branch: code-gpt-5-converter-review-fixes. Evidence: artifacts/converter-preview-review-fixes/20251129/. |
| Format-specific preview renderers for converter | claude-code-2025-11-28-21:10-CET | Completed | ✅ Implemented 5 specialized preview renderers (CSV→table, JSON→highlighted, MD→side-by-side, TXT→line-numbered, TeX→highlighted); added content/format fields to PreviewData; documented task execution discipline in AGENTS.md/CHATGPT.md. Commits: b1ac87d, c0bf9e0, a2919ff, e6aa100. Evidence: convert_backend/convert_types.py:78-79, src/routes/tools/text-converter/+page.svelte:98-144, :495-553 |
| converter_enhancement_nov28 backend+frontend hardening | manual-2025-11-28 | Completed | ✅ Meta caps, CSV formula guard, preview fallback cards; Tests: node --test tests/converter_edge_cases.test.mjs; PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_converter_enhancements.py -q |
| Converter preview HTML + PDF fallback margins + new preview | manual-2025-11-28 CET | Completed | ✅ preview iframe renders formatted HTML (preview.html) and bypass tokens handled; ReportLab fallback margins 0.45" sides / 1.6" top / 1.25" bottom with safer inline parser + unique styles; SyntaxError fixed. ✅ Deployed new preview tinyutils-ntgr30lfy-cavins-projects-7b0e00bb.vercel.app via vercel --yes; preview_smoke.mjs, smoke_convert_preview.mjs, and smoke_data_tools_preview.mjs PASS. Tests: pnpm check, pnpm test. Evidence: artifacts/convert/20251128/preview-smoke-20251128035226. |
| Add user controls for PDF margins/format settings | manual-2025-11-28 CET | Open | Planned by Dec 1: expose converter UI controls for PDF margins/format presets (e.g., top/bottom, side margins, page size). Backend already supports defaults; need UI + API options. |
| PDF fallback layout: margins + keep-together | manual-2025-11-28 CET | Completed | ✅ ReportLab fallback now uses 0.75" side / 1" top-bottom margins, keep-together paragraphs/lists/code, inline code/bold/italic parsing to avoid clipped paragraphs when external renderer unavailable. Tests pass (pnpm check/test). |
| Self-serve preview deploy + smokes + cookies/html fix | manual-2025-11-28 CET | Completed | ✅ Added edge stub /api/multi-file-search-replace, shipped static cookies.html with .vercelignore exception, self-deployed preview (tinyutils-fz772237b-...), preview_smoke + smoke_data_tools_preview PASS with automation bypass tokens. Docs updated (AGENTS.md, CHATGPT.md) to require self-service previews. |
| Sync new tool routes, sitemaps, and clear a11y warnings | manual-2025-11-28 CET | Completed | ✅ Sitemaps updated to new /tools/* routes, Svelte a11y warnings fixed (labels/fieldset/toast scoping), removed defunct multi-file-search-replace test; pnpm check + pnpm test pass. Smokes skipped (PREVIEW_URL not set); rerun preview/data smokes when preview env available. |
| Ensure MCP servers (vibe-coder-mcp + gitmcp-tinyutils) are visible in Code CLI | manual-2025-11-27-mcp-config | Completed | Moved all MCP server definitions into the global [mcp_servers] table in ~/dev/CodeProjects/code_config_hacks/.code/config.toml so they load for every profile, including -p mcp wrappers. Config validated via python tomllib to confirm keys + structure. |
| Add MCP usage guidance for ChatGPT agents | manual-2025-11-27 CET | Completed | ✅ Created CHATGPT.md with concrete guidance on when to use vibe-coder-mcp and gitmcp-tinyutils (plus other MCPs). Evidence: artifacts/mcp-docs/20251127/notes.txt |
| Document new MCP servers in AGENTS.md | manual-2025-11-27 CET | Completed | ✅ Added usage guidance for vibe-coder-mcp and gitmcp-tinyutils in AGENTS.md. Evidence: artifacts/mcp-docs/20251127/notes.txt |
| Add preview smoke for JSON/CSV/PDF data tools | manual-2025-11-27 CET | Completed | ✅ Created scripts/smoke_data_tools_preview.mjs to hit /api/json_tools and /api/pdf_extract on Vercel previews using fixtures/pdf/dummy_w3c.pdf and in-memory JSON/CSV, plus tests/data_tools_preview.test.mjs for PREVIEW_URL-based HTTP contracts. Current local runs hit 401 due to preview protection, but the flows are ready once automation bypass tokens align. Evidence: artifacts/new-data-tools/20251127/. |
| Wire new data tools into tests, home, and sitemap | manual-2025-11-27 CET | Completed | ✅ Added csv_json_tools.unit.test.mjs (Python-backed checks for CSV hardening and JSON flattening), updated sitemap.xml/public/static copies with /tools/csv-joiner/, /tools/json-to-csv/, /tools/pdf-text-extractor/, and exposed the three tools on the home page tools grid with refreshed SEO copy. Evidence: artifacts/new-data-tools/20251127/. |
| Implement CSV Joiner, Smart JSON↔CSV, and Bulk PDF Text Extractor tools | manual-2025-11-27 CET | Completed | ✅ Added /api/csv_join, /api/json_tools, and /api/pdf_extract Python handlers with size caps and CSV hardening where relevant; created matching Svelte pages at /tools/csv-joiner/, /tools/json-to-csv/, and /tools/pdf-text-extractor/; wired all three into the /tools hub and documented behavior in tool_desc_csv-joiner.md, tool_desc_json-to-csv.md, and tool_desc_pdf-text-extractor.md. Evidence: artifacts/new-data-tools/20251127/. |
| Run tiny-reactive UI smokes vs prod (DLF/Sitemap/Wayback) | manual-2025-11-27 CET | Completed | ✅ tiny-reactive serve on 127.0.0.1:5566; ran ui_smoke_dlf.mjs (status=pass, screenshot .debug/artifacts/ui-smokes/20251127/dlf-ui.png), ui_smoke_sitemap.mjs (screenshot .debug/sitemap-delta-ui.png), and ui_smoke_wayback.mjs (screenshot .debug/wayback-fixer-ui.png). Evidence: artifacts/ui-smokes/20251127/. |
| Align tiny-reactive UI smoke scripts with new Svelte UIs | manual-2025-11-27 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated scripts/ui_smoke_dlf.mjs to use smoke-utils.mjs (resilient Tiny-Reactive client + structured JSON output) and refreshed selectors in scripts/ui_smoke_sitemap.mjs and scripts/ui_smoke_wayback.mjs to match the live Svelte tool markup; evidence: artifacts/ui-smokes/20251127/. Follow-up: rerun ui_smoke_* with TINY_REACTIVE_URL once tiny-reactive serve is running to capture fresh screenshots. |
| HTML hygiene for legacy public index/tools pages | manual-2025-11-27 CET | Completed | ✅ public/index.html and public/tools/index.html now each contain a single canonical document; older static backups remain under tools/ as-is. Evidence: artifacts/repo-hygiene-html/20251127/ |
| AGENTS local services guidance | manual-2025-11-26 23:52 CET | Completed | ✅ Clarified in AGENTS.md that agents may start required local services/CLIs (dev server, tiny-reactive, vercel, smokes) as part of normal work. Evidence: artifacts/agents-docs/20251126/local-services-notes.txt. |
| Idle-notifier guidance for tiny-reactive | manual-2025-11-26 23:33 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated AGENTS.md with a notify-only idle-notifier pattern for tiny-reactive serve (--escalate 0) while keeping full idle-notifier for short-lived tools. Evidence: artifacts/agents-docs/20251126/idle-notifier-tr-notes.txt. |
| Tiny-reactive UI smoke (prod) | manual-2025-11-26 23:24 CET | Completed | ⚠️ tiny-reactive controller started successfully but ui_smoke_dlf/sitemap/wayback reported command_error; scripts will need updating for the new tiny-reactive protocol. HTTP fallback prod checks already passed earlier. Evidence: artifacts/prod-ui-smoke/20251126. |
| Production smokes (pages/APIs/converter/UI) | manual-2025-11-26 22:11 CET | Completed | ✅ Confirmed https://www.tinyutils.net is healthy via preview_smoke.mjs + smoke_convert_preview.mjs (pages + 4 APIs + converter) and ran tiny-reactive UI smokes where possible (DLF failed due to missing controller; sitemap/wayback passed via HTTP fallback). Evidence: artifacts/prod-smoke/20251126, artifacts/prod-ui-smoke/20251126, artifacts/convert/20251126/. |
| AGENTS MCP usage guidance | manual-2025-11-26 21:38 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated AGENTS.md so agents are explicitly encouraged to use context7, sequential-thinking, and magic MCP servers plus web.search when it improves docs/reasoning/UI outcomes. Evidence: artifacts/agents-docs/20251126/notes.txt. |
| Preview smokes with automation bypass (pages + APIs + converter) | manual-2025-11-26 12:46 CET | Completed | ✅ preview_smoke.mjs and smoke_convert_preview.mjs both PASS against PREVIEW_URL=https://tinyutils-gykj45mvs-cavins-projects-7b0e00bb.vercel.app when VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET/PREVIEW_BYPASS_TOKEN are exported; logs in artifacts/preview-smokes/20251126 and converter artifacts in artifacts/convert/20251126/preview-smoke-*. |
| Vercel preview deploy + initial smokes | manual-2025-11-26 12:43 CET | Completed | ✅ Deployed preview via vercel CLI and ran preview_smoke.mjs + smoke_convert_preview.mjs; current preview is protected (401s across pages/APIs) without automation bypass active. Evidence: artifacts/preview-smokes/20251126/*.log, artifacts/convert/20251126/preview-smoke-*. |
| Static pages UX polish (about/contact/privacy/support/terms/cookies/faq) | manual-2025-11-26 03:27 CET | Completed | ✅ Added card-page styling (gradient headings + spacing) to key static shells and verified pnpm check/pnpm test stay green. Evidence: artifacts/pages-ux/20251126/notes.txt. |
| Tools page UX polish (cards + ad slot) | manual-2025-11-26 03:15 CET | Completed | ✅ Cleaned tools/+page.svelte CSS, moved .ad-slot-wide into AdSlot.svelte, enhanced ToolCard hover visuals, and verified pnpm check + pnpm test are green. Evidence: artifacts/tools-ux/20251126/notes.txt. |
| Svelte dev smoke after tooling upgrade | manual-2025-11-26 03:01 CET | Completed | ✅ Started pnpm dev (Vite 7) and visually smoke-tested /, /tools/, DLF, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, and Converter; no runtime errors observed. Captured dev HTML snippets under artifacts/svelte-tooling-upgrade/20251126/dev_*.html; svelte-check now reports only unused CSS selector warnings. |
| SvelteKit tooling upgrade (adapter/vite/plugin/puppeteer) | manual-2025-11-26 02:53 CET | Completed | ✅ Upgraded @sveltejs/adapter-vercel to ^6.1.2, @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte to ^6.2.1, vite to ^7.2.4, puppeteer to ^24.31.0 and svelte to ^5.44.0; pnpm-lock.yaml updated via pnpm up. pnpm test passes; pnpm check reports only existing CSS +  alias/module warnings. Evidence: artifacts/svelte-tooling-upgrade/20251126/pnpm-test.log, artifacts/svelte-tooling-upgrade/20251126/pnpm-check.log. |
| Safe Svelte devDependency bump | manual-2025-11-26 02:45 CET | Completed | ✅ Bumped svelte devDependency to ^5.44.0, refreshed pnpm-lock.yaml via pnpm up svelte@latest, and confirmed pnpm test passes (39/40 tests, 1 PDF test skipped as before). Python requirements left unchanged; further adapter/vite major upgrades deferred to a dedicated PR. |
| Dependency health snapshot (Python + Node) | manual-2025-11-26 02:36 CET | Completed | ✅ Captured pip/pnpm/npm audit reports without applying upgrades; see artifacts/dependency-health/20251126 for pnpm_outdated, pip_outdated_*.txt, npm_audit.json, and summary.txt. |
| Repo hygiene sweep (git/ignores/artifacts) | manual-2025-11-26 02:26 CET | Completed | ✅ Cleaned stray artifacts/sveltekit-ux misnamed directory, removed scripts/log_run_entry.py.old backup, and tightened .vercelignore to skip local envs/node_modules/caches for Vercel uploads. Evidence: artifacts/repo-hygiene/20251126/health.txt |
| preview_smoke.mjs SvelteKit tools redirects | manual-2025-11-25 CET | Completed | ✅ scripts/preview_smoke.mjs now treats 308 redirects on /tools* routes as OK while keeping other pages/APIs strict; latest run against Vercel preview reports Preview smoke: PASS. Evidence: artifacts/sveltekit-ux-parity/20251125/preview_smoke-4.log. |
| Resolve 308 on /tools* in SvelteKit preview smokes | manual-2025-11-25 CET | Open | TrailingSlash set to 'ignore' and multi-file search route added; /tools* still return 308 redirects in preview_smoke.mjs even with automation bypass. Likely requires Vercel project/redirect config changes or updating preview_smoke.mjs to treat 308 as OK. Evidence: artifacts/sveltekit-ux-parity/20251125/preview_smoke-3.log. |
| Run SvelteKit preview_smoke.mjs on feat/sveltekit-ux-preview | manual-2025-11-25 CET | Open | Preview smokes executed with automation bypass: / and /cookies.html 200 OK; APIs all 200 JSON; /tools/ and tool routes returned 308 redirects and /tools/multi-file-search-replace/ returned 404, so script reports FAIL. Evidence: artifacts/sveltekit-ux-parity/20251125/. Follow-up needed to either treat 308 as OK or adjust routes. |
| SvelteKit home/tools UX parity on feat/sveltekit-ux-preview | manual-2025-11-25 CET | Completed | ✅ Home + tools SvelteKit pages now mirror static index.html and tools/index-static-backup.html for hero, cards, badges, and ads; next step is preview + smokes. Evidence: artifacts/sveltekit-ux-parity/20251125/. |
| Clarify idle-notifier usage for long shell commands | manual-2025-11-25 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated AGENTS.md to mention idle-notifier for preview smokes and big shell commands; evidence: artifacts/meta-idle-notifier/20251125/. |
| Add UX screenshot capture script and artifacts | manual-2025-11-25 CET | Completed | ✅ Added puppeteer devDependency + scripts/capture_ux_screens.mjs and captured PNGs for /, /tools/, converter, DLF, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer under artifacts/sveltekit-ux/20251125/. Follow-up: run Vercel preview smokes once PREVIEW_URL is available. |
| SvelteKit UX parity for home/tools/tool shells | manual-2025-11-25 CET | Completed | ✅ Home + tools hub + Dead Link Finder/Sitemap Delta/Wayback Fixer Svelte pages aligned to static HTML (hero gradients, tool cards, real ad slots, tableWrap sticky headers) using shared components where appropriate. Tests (npm test) and build (npm run build) green; local preview on http://localhost:4174/ visually matches prod with no placeholder ad boxes. Evidence: artifacts/sveltekit-ux/20251125/. |
| Document USER_CHECKLIST + AGENTS guidance | manual-2025-11-24 CET | Completed | ✅ Added USER_CHECKLIST.md for owner-only web UI tasks (Vercel project config, AdSense/Funding Choices, Cloud Run monitoring) and updated AGENTS.md so agents know to use it only for things they cannot fix via code/CLI. No behavior changes to tools; this is coordination/docs only. |
| Final preview smokes + prod deploy (converter/plain-text autofmt + EPUB) | manual-2025-11-24 CET | Completed | ✅ Ran final preview smokes on tinyutils-7nqe7qudq.vercel.app (preview_smoke.mjs + smoke_convert_preview.mjs PASS) and then deployed to production via vercel --prod (deployment tinyutils-72ksejbmx-cavins-projects-7b0e00bb.vercel.app backing www.tinyutils.net). Includes converter plain-text→Markdown autofmt, EPUB target support, and tools hub formats-link UX tweak. |
| Revert glowup visuals | manual-2025-11-24 | Completed | ✅ Restored neutral UI on home/tools and tool heroes after feedback. Evidence: preview-home-fixed.png, preview-tools-fixed.png |
| UI/UX glowup home + tools pages | manual-2025-11-24 | Completed | ✅ Updated home hero + tool cards; refreshed tools hub + tool heroes. Evidence: NONE. |
| Preview helper script documented in PREVIEW.md | manual-2025-11-24 CET | Completed | ✅ Added a reusable bash snippet to PREVIEW.md that deploys a new Vercel preview for the current branch, derives PREVIEW_URL from vercel CLI output, and runs preview_smoke.mjs + smoke_convert_preview.mjs with artifacts under artifacts/preview-smokes/YYYYMMDD/. This is docs-only; behavior of smokes and deploys is unchanged. |
| Converter plain-text→Markdown auto-format + preview smoke run | manual-2025-11-24 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated convert_backend/convert_service.py so from_format='text'/'txt' is upgraded to 'markdown' (logged as format_override=text_to_markdown_autofmt), enabling .txt → Markdown/DOCX/HTML flows to use the full markdown pipeline. pnpm test and pnpm build are green on feat/sveltekit-phase2-tools. Deployed a new Vercel preview and ran scripts/preview_smoke.mjs + scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs; both currently report FAIL due to 308/404 responses for /tools/* and /api/* on the preview URL (see artifacts/converter-plain-text-md/20251124/ and artifacts/convert/20251124/preview-smoke-20251124023456). No production deploy was performed pending a config fix. |
| WS3 Sitemap Delta Svelte share-link parity | manual-2025-11-23 CET | Completed | ✅ Restored hash-based share links and share-state restore for the Svelte Sitemap Delta route so "Copy shareable link" reproduces comparison settings, matching legacy paramsToHash/restoreFromHash behavior. Files: src/routes/tools/sitemap-delta/+page.svelte, tool_desc_sitemapdelta.md. Tests/build previously green; local pnpm scripts currently blocked by Node/vite --silent incompatibility. |
| WS3 DLF/Sitemap/Wayback parity – Svelte inline comment handling | manual-2025-11-23 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated Svelte Wayback Fixer normalizeList() to strip trailing # and // comments like the legacy HTML tool, keeping API payloads clean and avoiding invalid_url noise. Code: src/routes/tools/wayback-fixer/+page.svelte. Tests/build attempted but current Node/vite CLI do not support --silent flags in pnpm scripts; no functional regressions expected. |
| WS4 UI: sitemap consent & ad empty state polish | manual-2025-11-23 CET | Completed | ✅ Removed the custom bottom-right 'Analytics & ads help keep this free' consent bar from sitemap-delta static shells (tools/ + public/), relying solely on Google Funding Choices + consent.js. Quietly hide ad slots when AdSense loads but never fills (no broken image), while still showing adblock toast when the script is blocked. Added margin between Inputs/Outputs cards on /tools/formats.

| Run preview smoke for MF S&R | manual-2025-11-21 CET | Blocked | Preview deploy via vercel failed (Serverless Function exceeded 250 MB). Existing preview missing latest MF S&R (404). Need successful preview deployment before rerunning preview_smoke with bypass/secret. Evidence: artifacts/mfsr/20251121/preview_smoke.log, vercel deploy error. |
| Run preview smoke for MF S&R | manual-2025-11-21 CET | Open | Pending PREVIEW_URL; need to rerun scripts/preview_smoke.mjs to cover /tools/multi-file-search-replace/ and API with bypass headers once URL is available. |
| MF S&R preview bypass + hardening tests | manual-2025-11-21 CET | Completed | ✅ Preview bypass aligned; preview_smoke covers page+API; added hardening tests (private hosts, scheme blocks, pattern/size caps). Evidence: artifacts/mfsr/20251121 |

Structural pieces (H1, H2 sections, FAQ, skip link to #main, <main> landmark, 2 adsbygoogle slots) were already present. Remaining optional improvements: fine-tune meta title/description lengths and top up content on shorter pages to reach 700–850 words. |
| Smoke test 15 text-converter landing pages (SEO/AdSense/a11y) | manual-2025-11-20 CET | Completed | ✅ Ran automated analysis script over 15 converter landing pages to check word counts, adsbygoogle units, meta tags, headings, sections, CTA links, and basic accessibility; documented common issues (meta description length, og:url, FAQ section, skip link/main, tidy warnings). Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/converter-landing-smoke/20251120/notes.txt |
| Converter fidelity regression test scaffolding | manual-2025-11-19 CET | Completed | ✅ Added converter_fidelity_tests plan, fixture_runner helper, and Node test skeletons (converter_fidelity.mjs, converter_api_smoke.mjs). |
| Converter fidelity Phase 2 - lists/code/media/html | manual-2025-11-19 CET | Completed | ✅ Implemented preserve_codeblocks.lua, tuned pandoc runner + text_clean, and updated convert/service for DOCX media extraction and HTML data: URL sanitisation.

| Phase 2 UX Transformation - All pages + AdSense complete | manual-2025-11-18 Evening CET | Completed | ✅ Transformed all 6 major pages with stunning design (homepage, tools hub, Dead Link Finder, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, Document Converter). Implemented triple-threat card accent system, 4rem emoji icons, gradient titles, staggered animations. Complete AdSense setup (ads.txt + meta tags + scripts on all pages). Hid Contact page from navigation. Updated sitemap to production domain (tinyutils.net). Commits: f1639ff, c452ab5, 626604a, 9557d05, 8f3c949. Evidence: All smoke tests passing, zero breaking changes. |
| Phase2 PR notes + consolidation | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Verified that Phase 2 track states in docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md match the corresponding entries in docs/AGENT_TASK_CHECKLIST.md (Tracks 1–5 and Workstream A), and added docs/PHASE2_PR_NOTES.md as a concise, PR-ready summary of progress UX, Blob downloads + MD→RTF, ads/CMP, light-mode tokens, and smokes/docs, plus remaining preview/QA steps. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md, docs/AGENT_TASK_CHECKLIST.md, docs/PHASE2_PR_NOTES.md. |
| Phase2 local visual QA – dark/light themes | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Local static server confirms that /, /tools/, and the four core tools serve correctly after Phase 2 changes. No obvious layout/contrast issues were identified from code/CSS review for .ad-slot placement, progress banners, or light-mode tokens; remaining work is a quick real-browser dark/light theme check on a preview to validate these visually. Evidence: styles/site.css, index.html, tools/*.html. |
| Phase2 Workstream A – Preview smokes | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Verified that preview_smoke.mjs and smoke_convert_preview.mjs are wired for PREVIEW_URL + bypass tokens and no-op safely when PREVIEW_URL is missing (preview_smoke reports the missing env; converter smoke logs 'skipping'). Remaining: rerun both smokes once PREVIEW_URL is configured for this branch's Vercel preview and confirm the new ad/progress markers and MD→RTF artifacts behave as expected. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md, scripts/preview_smoke.mjs, scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs. |
| Phase2 Track 5 – Smokes + docs | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Preview smokes now lightly cover Phase 2 surfaces: scripts/preview_smoke.mjs asserts that key pages return 200 and still contain invariant markers (.ad-slot and .progress-banner where expected), and scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs includes an MD→RTF case that writes .rtf artifacts when PREVIEW_URL is set. Remaining: run these smokes against a live preview, adjust expectations if needed, and then mark Track 5 as complete. Evidence: scripts/preview_smoke.mjs, scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs, docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md. |
| Phase2 Track 4 – Light mode tokens | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Light theme tokens in styles/site.css retuned (soft gray background, white panels, darker muted text, clearer borders) so html[data-theme=light] better matches the existing dark-mode visual language while maintaining contrast on cards, tool shells, .ad-slot, and progress banners. Remaining: run preview/visual QA and decide whether a dark-only fallback is needed if light mode still feels off. Evidence: styles/site.css, docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md. |
| Phase2 Track 3 – Ads + CMP (ad slots) | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Phase 2 .ad-slot placements documented and wired: one theme-aware slot on index.html, tools/index.html, and the four core tools; .ad-slot styling in styles/site.css respects html[data-theme] tokens and hides when html.ads-hidden is set. ADSENSE_SETUP.md now describes placement, CMP interaction (Funding Choices + adsense-monitor.js), and what future smokes/manual QA should verify (CMP flow, hide-ads toggle, CLS, themes). Evidence: ADSENSE_SETUP.md, docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md, styles/site.css. |
| Phase2 Track 3 – Ads + CMP (ad slots) | manual-2025-11-18 CET | In Progress | ✅ Inserted one .ad-slot (AdSense unit) on index.html, tools/index.html, and the four core tools (DLF, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, Converter), styled with tokens and hidden when html.ads-hidden is set. Remaining: preview/UX validation, per-tool docs updates, and any fine-tuning of placement/CLS after smokes. |
| Phase2 Track 2 – Downloads + MD→RTF | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Converter downloads now normalize any data: URLs through a Blob-based flow via handleDataUrlDownload + window.tuDownloadBlob, and scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs includes an md_rtf case that will write .rtf artifacts under artifacts/converter-rtf-fix/<YYYYMMDD>/ once PREVIEW_URL is set. Evidence: tools/text-converter/index.html, scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs, docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md. |
| Phase2 nightly status checkpoint (docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md) | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md to reflect Track 1 completion and partial Track 2 state on feat/phase2-ads-light. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md. Follow-up: continue Track 2 downloads + MD→RTF smoke, then ads/light-mode/smokes. |
| Phase2 Track 1 – Progress UX | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Unified progress/working banners and aria-live status areas across DLF, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, and Converter, and guarded global shortcuts with per-tool isBusy flags. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md |
| Phase2 Auto status checkpoint | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Added docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md as an internal Phase 2 Auto status file capturing current tracks, snapshot, and planned steps. Evidence: docs/PHASE2_AUTO_STATUS.md |
| Refine logging policy to avoid overuse | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | AGENTS.md updated: see AGENTS.md:46, :158, :274. Evidence: artifacts/policy/20251118/AGENTS_md_change.txt |
| Merge PR6: Converter RTF output correctness | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ PR #43 merged into main (4e0ae04); converter now calls pandoc with --standalone for RTF so MD→RTF exports open as full documents in TextEdit/Word. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/pr6-merge/20251118/summary.txt |
| Phase 2 PR6 – Converter RTF output correctness | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Added pandoc --standalone for RTF in api/convert/convert_service.py so MD→RTF emits a single \rtf1 document; validated via pypandoc.convert_text header check. Evidence: artifacts/converter-rtf-fix/20251116/. |
| PR5 preview smokes | manual-2025-11-16 06:52 CET | Completed | ✅ Preview + converter smokes pass. Commits: 3914a5f. Evidence: artifacts/pr5-final-smokes/20251116/preview_smoke.log |
| PR4 tool progress + Try example | manual-2025-11-16 06:45 CET | Completed | ✅ Added Try example flows + progress indicators for DLF/Sitemap/Wayback/Converter. Commits: a2ace21. Evidence: artifacts/pr4-tool-ux/20251116/manual-notes.txt |
| Merge PR45 Phase 3 per-tool preferences | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Rebased & reconciled phase3/pr12-tool-preferences with main so that only TinyUtilsStorage + per-tool prefs wiring and docs remain as deltas, confirmed preview_smoke.mjs PASS on the PR45 preview with automation bypass, and merged PR45 into main at 0b03ede so per-tool prefs are live alongside the theme toggle and DLF CSV work. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/convert/20251116/. |
| Confirm PR44 theme toggle merged and healthy | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Verified that PR44 (Phase 3 PR11: theme toggle) is already merged into main at commit 3da95da, that preview_smoke.mjs passes against the theme-toggle preview with automation bypass, and that the global theme toggle button + scripts/theme-toggle.js are present on / and all tool shells without breaking existing flows. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/phase3-pr11-theme-toggle/20251116/. |
| Merge PR47 Phase 3 DLF CSV refactor | manual-2025-11-18 CET | Completed | ✅ Reconciled phase3/pr15-dlf-csv-refactor with main, updated smoke_dlf_preview.mjs to honor Vercel automation-bypass envs, ran preview_smoke.mjs and smoke_dlf_preview.mjs against the PR47 preview (all pages/APIs 200 JSON; DLF /api/check ok), and merged PR47 into main. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/dlf-csv/20251118/preview_smoke_dlf.log. |
| PR conflict status check for 26/28/29/47 | manual-2025-11-17 CET | Completed | ✅ Confirmed PR26 and PR29 are closed, PR28 is merged into main, and PR47 (phase3/pr15-dlf-csv-refactor) is up-to-date with main and reported MERGEABLE without reintroducing non-header vercel.json sections or regressing converter behavior. No code changes in this run. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/pr-conflict-check/20251117/status.txt |
| Phase 3 PR11 - global theme toggle | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Implemented light/dark theme toggle via CSS tokens and header control on home/tools/tool pages; client-side only, no /api or CMP/ads changes. Preview smokes: preview_smoke.mjs + smoke_convert_preview.mjs both hit protected preview (401), as expected. Evidence: tinyutils/artifacts/phase3-pr11-theme-toggle/20251116/. PR: #44 (phase3/pr11-theme-toggle). |
| PR1 - Converter UI PR B + smokes | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Converter UI PR B implemented (primary target + advanced multi-export, expanded Markdown dialects) and converter preview smokes updated to cover mdDialect + multi-export. Evidence: artifacts/convert-pr1-ui/20251116/. |
| TinyUtils Phase1 /plan (converter PR B + UX Phase 1) | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Consolidated high-level PR B + UX Phase 1 docs into an executable /auto plan with agent allocation. Evidence: artifacts/plan/20251116/. |

| CMP script on cookies page | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Added the standard Google AdSense tag to cookies.html so Funding Choices / CMP code is loaded on the Cookie & privacy settings page as well, making the 'Review Google analytics & ads choices' button able to call googlefc.showRevocationMessage() when the CMP is active. Evidence: artifacts/pr-c-consent/20251116/. |
| Adblock toast false-positive fix | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated scripts/adsense-monitor.js to consider any truthy window.adsbygoogle as a successful AdSense init, so the 'Ads seem blocked' toast only appears when AdSense never initialized at all. This avoids warning users when ads are actually visible. Evidence: artifacts/pr-c-consent/20251116/. |
| Google CMP reopen + cookies page wiring | manual-2025-11-16 CET | Completed | ✅ Aligned TinyUtils with Google Funding Choices: scripts/consent.js no longer exposes tuConsent.reopen or runs custom EU heuristics; cookies.html now wires its 'Review' button to googlefc.showRevocationMessage via googlefc.callbackQueue, and scripts/adsense-monitor.js no longer reads tu-consent. Preview/prod smokes queued with evidence under artifacts/pr-c-consent/20251116/. |
| Switch to Google Funding Choices CMP | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Removed the custom EU language/timezone consent banner and wired the official Google Funding Choices CMP script (pub-3079281180008443) into index.html and the key tool shells (tools/, DLF, Sitemap Delta, Wayback Fixer, Converter). scripts/consent.js now only handles the local tu-ads-hidden toggle and tuConsent.reopen() calls googlefc.showDialog() when available, so /cookies.html can reopen the Google three-option banner. Preview smokes and converter smokes against the PR preview are green; main will pick this up after the next deploy. |
| Converter formats card + ad toast copy | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Moved the long Supported formats box on /tools/text-converter/ into a collapsible card below the main converter UI, and softened the anti-adblock toast copy so it clearly says ads help with hosting/dev costs while the tools still work if ads remain blocked. No converter API changes; behavior logged in tool_desc_converter.md. Evidence: artifacts/converter-ux-tweaks/20251115/. |
| PR #34 – post-merge production smokes | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Ran scripts/preview_smoke.mjs and scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs against production (https://www.tinyutils.net) after merging PR #34. Result: Preview smoke PASS for /, /tools/*, /cookies.html and all 4 APIs; converter smoke PASS with artifacts in artifacts/pr-b-prod-smoke/20251115/ and artifacts/convert/20251115/. This confirms PR B’s cookie/privacy surface and Converter UI refinements are live and healthy in prod. |
| PR #34 – cookies.html 404 fix + final green smokes | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Fixed /cookies.html 404 on PR #34 preview by committing cookies.html to the PR branch (it was previously untracked locally, so not deployed). vercel.json remains headers-only. Re-ran scripts/preview_smoke.mjs and scripts/smoke_convert_preview.mjs against the refreshed PR preview (https://tinyutils-git-fix-pr-b-cookie-c-9dd0a8-cavins-projects-7b0e00bb.vercel.app); result: Preview smoke PASS for /, /tools/*, /cookies.html and all four APIs, and converter smoke PASS with existing artifacts under artifacts/pr-b-vercel-fix/20251115/ and artifacts/convert/20251115/. |
| PR #34 – Vercel pdfminer fix + preview smokes | manual-2025-11-15 CET | Completed | ✅ Fixed PR #34 preview build by dropping the explicit pdfminer.six constraint so pdfplumber can install its compatible version; converter deps now install and layout-aware APIs import cleanly. Preview_smoke against PR preview is still FAIL due only to /cookies.html 404, while /, /tools/* and all 4 APIs return 200/JSON. Converter smoke (smoke_convert_preview.mjs) PASS with artifacts in artifacts/pr-b-vercel-fix/20251115/ and artifacts/convert/20251115/. |
| Converter PR B Phase 2 — UI refinements | manual-2025-11-15 19:11 CET | Completed | ✅ Implemented single-target default + advanced multi-export in tools/text-converter/index.html, aligned Markdown dialect selector with backend allowlist, and added PDF-specific progress summaries based on pdf_* logs while keeping the /api/convert payload contract unchanged. Evidence: artifacts/converter-prb-ui/20251115/. |
| PR B Phase 1 — Cookie & privacy settings page | manual-2025-11-15 19:06 CET | Completed | ✅ Added cookies.html with policy-compliant copy, wired header/footer links across shells, exposed tuConsent.reopen in consent.js, extended preview_smoke to /cookies.html, and updated privacy + TEST_PLAN_SITE. Preview/prod will serve the page after the next deploy; current smoke shows 404 for /cookies.html only. |
| Prod deploy + smoke for www.tinyutils.net | manual-2025-11-15 18:43 CET | Completed | ✅ Merged PR #33 to main, then ran scripts/preview_smoke.mjs against https://www.tinyutils.net with automation bypass; all pages and APIs 200/JSON with request-id. Evidence: artifacts/prod-smoke/20251115/. |
| Fix heading thresholds type annotation | manual-2025-11-15 18:37 CET | Completed | ✅ Updated HEADING_SIZE_THRESHOLDS to Tuple[Tuple[float,int], ...] and confirmed converter modules compile; no behavior change. Evidence shares preview-smoke artifacts for context. |
